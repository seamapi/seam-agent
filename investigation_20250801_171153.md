Hello team!
We are checking an Igloohome device that does not seem to be connected to a bridge, so it only supports offline functionality. However, the device response says that it can program online access codes. Is that correct?

## 🔍 Investigation Results

🔍 **Device Analysis**: Unnamed Igloohome Lock (267ed8d4-3933-4e71-921a-53ce3736879a)

⚠️ **Issue Identified**: Device reports online access code programming capability despite not being connected to a bridge
📊 **Status**: Under Investigation - Requires Admin Interface Review

📋 **Timeline**:
• Retrieved basic device information confirming Igloohome lock identity
• Generated admin interface links for deeper investigation
• Identified technical inconsistency between reported capabilities and actual connectivity

🔧 **Root Cause**: Device is reporting online access code programming capabilities while customer confirms it's not connected to a bridge. This creates a technical contradiction since online programming typically requires internet connectivity through bridge or direct Wi-Fi connection.

🎯 **Next Steps**:
1. **Use admin links below to verify device connectivity status and actual supported capabilities**
2. **Review device action history for any failed online programming attempts**
3. **Provide customer with definitive answer about their device's true online programming capabilities**

📎 **Additional Context**: Investigation limited by minimal device response data. Manual admin review required to resolve capability discrepancy and provide accurate technical response to customer.

**Admin Links for Further Investigation:**
- [Device Details](https://connect.getseam.com/admin/view_device?device_id=267ed8d4-3933-4e71-921a-53ce3736879a&quickwit=true) - Examine connectivity status, bridge connection, and capability configuration
- [Device Action History](https://connect.getseam.com/admin/view_device_action_attempts?device_id=267ed8d4-3933-4e71-921a-53ce3736879a) - Review online access code programming attempts and success/failure status
- [Workspace Configuration](https://connect.getseam.com/admin/view_workspace?device_id=267ed8d4-3933-4e71-921a-53ce3736879a) - Check workspace settings and device configuration

## 📋 Raw Analysis
```
## Investigation Steps

1. **get_device_info**: Retrieved basic device information showing an unnamed Igloohome lock (device ID: 267ed8d4-3933-4e71-921a-53ce3736879a)
2. **get_admin_links**: Generated three admin interface links to enable deeper investigation of device capabilities, action history, and workspace configuration

## Data Analysis

Based on the limited data gathered and the customer's specific question, here are the key findings:

**Device Configuration**: The device is confirmed to be an Igloohome lock, but the minimal response from get_device_info suggests potential connectivity or configuration issues that align with the customer's observation about it not being connected to a bridge.

**Core Issue**: The customer has identified a contradiction - their Igloohome device appears to only support offline functionality (not connected to bridge), yet the device response indicates it can program online access codes. This is technically inconsistent, as online access code programming typically requires internet connectivity through a bridge or direct Wi-Fi connection.

**Investigation Limitations**: The automated tools provided insufficient detail to definitively answer the customer's technical question about the device's actual capabilities versus what it reports.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Use Admin Links for Deep Investigation**:
   - Access the [Device Details](https://connect.getseam.com/admin/view_device?device_id=267ed8d4-3933-4e71-921a-53ce3736879a&quickwit=true) link to examine:
     - Device connectivity status and bridge connection
     - Supported capabilities configuration
     - Current device properties and settings

2. **Review Action History**:
   - Check the [Device Action History](https://connect.getseam.com/admin/view_device_action_attempts?device_id=267ed8d4-3933-4e71-921a-53ce3736879a) to see if online access code programming attempts have been made and their success/failure status

### Technical Verification:
3. **Validate Device Capabilities**: Determine if this specific Igloohome model supports:
   - Offline-only access code programming
   - Hybrid online/offline functionality
   - Bridge-independent online features

4. **Configuration Review**: Check if the device's reported capabilities match its actual hardware configuration and connectivity status

### Customer Communication:
5. **Clarify the Discrepancy**: Explain to the customer that this appears to be either:
   - A configuration error where the device is reporting incorrect capabilities
   - A specific Igloohome model that supports limited online features without a bridge
   - A connectivity issue that needs resolution

6. **Provide Definitive Answer**: After using the admin links, give the customer a clear yes/no answer about whether their device can actually program online access codes in its current configuration.

The investigation requires manual review through the admin interface to provide the customer with an accurate technical response about their device's true capabilities.
