# Core Principles
- DO NOT JUMP TO THE NEXT TASK OR START WRITING CODE!

## Iterative Development
- **Work Iteratively:** Start with the smallest possible change and build upon it.
- **Test Assumptions:** Frequently test your assumptions and understanding.
- **Don't Jump to Conclusions:** If you're unsure about the next step, ask for human input.

## Planning and Execution
- **Follow the Plan:** Always work from the `task.md` file if it exists.
- **Refer to PRD** Check in on `docs/customer-suport-agent-prd.md`
- **Track Progress:** Check off TODOs as they are completed.

## Simplicity and Focus
- **Keep it Simple:** Do not overcomplicate solutions.
- **Stay Focused:** Do not touch files or parts of files that are not directly related to the task at hand.
- **Be Precise:** Edits should be targeted and precise. Avoid making large, sweeping changes unless explicitly asked to.
- **Respect Existing Code:** Do not refactor or change code that is unrelated to the current task.

## Communication
- **Be Proactive:** If you encounter a problem or are unsure how to proceed, communicate this early.
- **Explain Your Reasoning:** Briefly explain why you are taking a certain action or making a specific change.
- **Ask Clarifying Questions:** If the request is ambiguous, ask for clarification before proceeding.# Core Principles
