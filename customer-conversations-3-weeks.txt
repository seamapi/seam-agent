TITLE: Aligning on data for billing/invoicing with `is_managed` flag and custom metadata
CUSTOMER: MyQ
WORKSPACE ID: Not specified
ASSIGNED TO: Jack Finley
TAGS: res: business ops
CREATED: 6/25/2025
CLOSED: 7/9/2025

SUMMARY: The customer and support team discussed aligning on data for billing, specifically using the `is_managed` flag and custom metadata at the device level. The customer proposed a meeting to finalize the approach, agreed on a time, and requested a list of attendees, which the support team provided along with their email addresses.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (Johnny Jung):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> we briefly talked about this on our last call but we need to align on the data we'll use for billing/invoicing. From what I understand, `is_managed` is used to determine which devices are eligible for billing.

But when we call Seam to get a list of devices for the user's ODM account, all devices' `is_managed` flag becomes `true` by default. For example, if I have 4 thermostats in my Ecobee account, and if I only bring 3 of the 4 devices to myQ, all 4 devices will still get `is_managed` = `true`.

To indicate which devices are actually being used, we'll add myQ account ID to custom metadata for each of the devices that are added to myQ. Can we align on checking the `is_managed` flag + the custom metadata at a device level for billing?

<@U07MBKKKLP3|Sathwick> please feel free to add more details/corrections if needed.

[6/25/2025] SUPPORT (Charles):
<@U04U257P1JT|Johnny Jung> most providers don’t allow you to select specific devices to bring in to Seam - instead they’ll give us all the devices and so we mark them as managed by default. To unmanage specific devices you can call the `/devices/update` endpoint: <https://docs.seam.co/latest/core-concepts/devices/managed-and-unmanaged-devices#convert-a-managed-device-to-unmanaged>

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Johnny Jung):
thanks <@U066W71LB7F|Charles>- as mentioned here, myQ account will be a necessary data to share to calculate billing. Our team believes sending the custom metadata only at the connected account level will not be reliable.

We are currently drafting a design on how we want to align on the data we share for billing. When we are ready, let's get on a call to align on it.

<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> please let me know who should be invited to the call.

<https://myq-cgi.slack.com/archives/C077M7KMZNX/p1748463685317989>

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U04U257P1JT|Johnny Jung> Yes, agreed a call next week would be great to touch base! Feel free to invite myself and I will add the relevant folks from our team

[7/1/2025] CUSTOMER (Johnny Jung):
Hi <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> <@U066W71LB7F|Charles> are you available at 11AM-12PM PT on 7/8 Tue to finalize our alignment on billing validation data?

I will send over a quick brief by the EOW how we would like to send over the data for billing so you can review internally before our meeting.

[7/1/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U04U257P1JT|Johnny Jung>, I will confirm with Charles/Dawn and follow-up shortly!

[7/2/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U04U257P1JT|Johnny Jung> Any chance we could do the same time on 7/10 Thursday?

[7/2/2025] CUSTOMER (Johnny Jung):

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/30/2025] CUSTOMER (Shiven):
Hi team, 

We have someone who has a few YaleXNest locks connected to the Nest app.

What’s the best way we can make those locks work with Sesm?

SUMMARY: The customer inquired about smart camera integration, and the support reps mentioned it is under consideration. They proposed scheduling a call to explore potential features, such as monitoring gym equipment usage for security and convenience.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/18/2025] CUSTOMER (Mark Beach):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> do y’all integrate with any smart cameras?

[6/18/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U018QCTSLS2|Mark Beach> Not yet, but is something we are strongly considering looking at adding. Do you have any particular brands/systems you're interested in?

[6/18/2025] CUSTOMER (Mark Beach):
I do not, but most of our customers who I have spoken with that already offer access have some kind of camera in the gym for added security

[6/18/2025] SUPPORT (Sy Bohy):
<@U018QCTSLS2|Mark Beach> may I schedule a call with you tomorrow or Friday? I want to do a super quick exploration of the features we’d need to build. For example, I’d love a camera at my gym so that I can know if certain machines or racks are currently occupied so that I can come by later

CLOSED: 6/25/2025

SUMMARY: The customer reported an issue with a lock removal event not being logged in Seam. The support rep clarified that no calls to remove the device were found in their logs and agreed to investigate why a 'device.removed' event was not sent from Yale.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/17/2025] CUSTOMER (volodymyr.yatsyk):
Hi

User claims they removed locks from the account, but we do not have any removed events from Seam.

Can you please help identify the issue
Lock: `07eb6af1-a1a2-46e0-a369-4e34be86cb21`

[6/17/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hi <@U082WS4C1BJ|volodymyr.yatsyk>, our team checked our internal logs for that device and we aren't seeing any calls to /device/delete or /device/remove anywhere for that ID.

[6/17/2025] CUSTOMER (Bohdan Rutylo):
&gt; /device/delete or /device/remove
Yale makes such calls if device removed on their end?

[6/18/2025] CUSTOMER (Bohdan Rutylo):
?

[6/18/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Ah sorry, I misread the message. I thought you meant they had removed their device from Guesty, not from the actual Yale account. I can investigate why a `device.removed` event might not have been sent.

TITLE: Support for Avigilon Alta devices not working in connection flow
CUSTOMER: Gymdesk
WORKSPACE ID: Not specified
ASSIGNED TO: Jack Finley
TAGS: tri: needs bug fix
CREATED: 6/23/2025
CLOSED: 7/14/2025

SUMMARY: The customer inquired about Avigilon Alta device support, which is available but in a potentially unstable beta state. The team decided to activate it for testing with a caveat about its reliability, but encountered issues with account setup. The support rep indicated plans to improve the integration over the next quarter but recommended delaying onboarding until stability improves, prompting the customer to consider alternative hardware solutions.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/23/2025] CUSTOMER (Eran Galperin):
Hey team, do you have support yet for Avigilon Alta devices? It shows up in your supported devices list, but not coming up through the device connection flow

[6/23/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@UF6TGBUJC|Eran Galperin> - we do have support for Avigilon Alta, make sure you are including `avigilon_alta` in your <https://docs.seam.co/latest/core-concepts/connect-webviews/customizing-connect-webviews#customize-the-brands-to-display-in-your-connect-webviews|Connect Webview>.

One note is that we are probably going to move Avigilon Alta to `beta` status, as we have noticed the integration is a bit more spotty than our `live` brands in production (i.e. Yale, Schlage) - so it's up to your team if they would like to offer it in the current state.

[6/23/2025] CUSTOMER (Eran Galperin):
Got it, thanks Jack. Are there plans on improving this connection to the point you'd consider it stable?

[6/23/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
I would love to say yes, but we don't have many customers using/requesting the integration so it's unlikely it becomes a priority for the team in the short-term.

[6/23/2025] CUSTOMER (Eran Galperin):
<@U0859FR3T0C|Alex Bohatka> It's supported, but likely not something we'd like to recommend to customers to use. See the above discussion

[6/23/2025] CUSTOMER (Alex Bohatka):
Thanks <@UF6TGBUJC|Eran Galperin>. Given the customer already has this hardware in place, should we still go with this or should I push them to buy new hardware? 

[6/23/2025] CUSTOMER (Eran Galperin):
We can give them the option to try it and see if it's working, but with the caveat that it might be spotty according to our integration partner

[6/23/2025] CUSTOMER (Alex Bohatka):
Copy. How can the customer see it in the Gymdesk portal? Is there anything needed on his end?

[6/23/2025] CUSTOMER (Eran Galperin):
We will need to activate it. <@U04VDGBDMEU|Antoan Stoykov> Can you add this to the connect webview tomorrow when you get online?

[6/23/2025] CUSTOMER (Alex Bohatka):
perfect, I'm going to communicate this to the customer now. Thanks Eran!

[6/24/2025] CUSTOMER (Antoan Stoykov):
Added Avigilon Alta to the provider list

[6/24/2025] CUSTOMER (Alex Bohatka):
Thank you <@U04VDGBDMEU|Antoan Stoykov>!

[6/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Antoan Stoykov):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> a member reported that adding Avigilon Alta account gets stuck at 99% and never completes. Is there anything we can do about that?

[6/27/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U04VDGBDMEU|Antoan Stoykov>, I shared this with our team and will try to have a firmer update on what we can do on Monday.

[6/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Antoan Stoykov):
Thank you

[7/2/2025] CUSTOMER (Dan Veillette):
Hi <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley>, any update on this?

[7/2/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U089VU8HV41|Dan Veillette> <@U04VDGBDMEU|Antoan Stoykov> Hey team, apologies for the delay here. We will be shoring up our integration over the coming quarter, but I can't confirm right now when this will be solved. If possible, I believe it'd be best to hold off on onboarding this customer for a bit until we can move Avigilon back to `stable` status.

[7/2/2025] CUSTOMER (Jay Wilson):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> That's a bummer since they're pretty much ready to go live with Gymdesk. What would be a comparable hardware solution?

TITLE: Issue with device lock and unlock capabilities
CUSTOMER: Enso
WORKSPACE ID: d4198b14-8520-4b41-a370-514c31f09523
ASSIGNED TO: Jack Finley
TAGS: tri: needs bug fix
CREATED: 6/23/2025
CLOSED: 7/1/2025

SUMMARY: A customer inquired about a device's lock and unlock capabilities, specifically the Nuki Opener. The support team confirmed that a fix was implemented to disable the lock feature, leaving only the unlock capability. However, the customer reported some devices still showing the lock button, and the support rep clarified that this depends on Enso's implementation, as Seam only surfaces the unlock capability.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/23/2025] CUSTOMER (AJ):
Hey team, we have a client wondering why their device has lock capabilities as it automatically locks and seems to be having issues with the lock and unlock capabilities. Is this expected to have both on your end? Is there a way to make this always default to unlock?

Device ID: f1246290-b5a9-41dc-ab26-694b6c42637a

[6/23/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U0505CR7CCV|AJ>, as a default I believe if we sense that the device has `lock` capabilities, we will always surface the `lock` and `unlock` feature. Could you share the specific device model from the customer so we can look into it further?

[6/23/2025] CUSTOMER (AJ):
Its the Nuki Opener!

[6/23/2025] CUSTOMER (AJ):


[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (Sarah Bergeron):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> Hey! Just wanted to follow-up here

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (AJ):
Let us know if you have an update :slightly_smiling_face:

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Sorry for the delay here team, let me follow-up internally where we are at with this. <@U0505CR7CCV|AJ> you mentioned the customer was "having issues with the lock and unlock capabilities" can you share any more detail there?

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U0505CR7CCV|AJ> <@U0755R3B001|Sarah Bergeron> The team said they pushed a fix for this, so now Nuki Opener's only have unlock capability and lock is disabled. let me know if you're still seeing any issues!

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (AJ):
Thank you!! we will keep you posted

[6/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Sarah Bergeron):
hey <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> it seems there's still some with the lock button, should that be fixed for all or only new bookings?

[6/27/2025] CUSTOMER (AJ):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> Device ID: 93f80225-5175-41a0-b1f7-90860cba8111

[6/27/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey team - that is going to be up to Enso's implementation I believe. I just double-checked that device and Seam is only surfacing the `can_remotely_unlock` capability flag cc <@U04H4ECKAAD|Bilal Khan>

SUMMARY: The support rep confirmed a fix for pushing access codes to keypads was implemented in production, but the customer indicated their partnership with Igloo is on hold indefinitely, potentially affecting their access control rollout.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/25/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U02P77QG5H6|Jeff O’Malley> I confirmed the fix to push access codes to the keypad not controller is in code review now. Hopefully should be pushed to production by EoD tomorrow!

[7/2/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U02P77QG5H6|Jeff O’Malley> sorry for the delay, following up here that we have officially pushed this fix to production. The customer should have no more issues with access codes but let us know if anything comes up!

[7/9/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U02P77QG5H6|Jeff O’Malley> - checking in here, has the client verified the fix on their locks? Are they using them in Production at their site again?

[7/9/2025] CUSTOMER (Jeff O’Malley):
Hey <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> - Our partnership with Igloo is on hold with an indefinite timeline to resolution.

[7/9/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U02P77QG5H6|Jeff O’Malley> Understood, thanks for the update - does that mean Wodify's access control rollout is indefinitely on hold too or will you be looking at other brands like Salto if the pricing can work out?

ASSIGNED TO: Jack Finley
TAGS: tri: needs bug fix
CREATED: 6/30/2025
CLOSED: 7/11/2025

SUMMARY: The customer reported a flaky connection warning on a device, but the support team clarified that the warning is triggered by brief offline events and advised ignoring it. The customer also mentioned issues with access codes not generating or setting, but the support team found recent codes successfully created and requested specific details for further investigation.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/30/2025] CUSTOMER (GlennP):
Hello team,

Need your assistance with this, please:

Device shows flaky connection in seam but client (also connected to the device through internet) is able to create codes just find without issues.

Any advise is appreciated.

Thanks,

[7/1/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U06K07YF7KM|GlennP>, this is an ongoing thread internally with how Seam is reporting the "Flaky Connection Warning". In summary, if we detect the device goes offline for even a second, we'll surface that warning which we realize can be noisy and create a misleading picture. For now, I would tell your customer to ignore the warning - we will let you know how we proceed.

[7/3/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
<@U06K07YF7KM|GlennP> I wanted to ask whether the seam events (device.disconnected, device.connected) are also a concern or if it is only the flaky warning that creates a concern? To echo what Jack said and add more details -

We started processing Schlage webhooks and more or less pass them through as we receive them. We are seeing disconnected events followed by a few seconds later a connected event (likely just a very short lived blip)

Up until now our flaky connection warning has looked at how many times we see a disconnected/connected event out of the last 10 events

[7/3/2025] CUSTOMER (GlennP):
Hello <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> and <@U0665SWKXPH|Chris>,

Other issue is that the codes are not generating and setting.

[7/4/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
&gt; Other issue is that the codes are not generating and setting.

When you say access codes are not generating and setting, I can see access codes created for this device in the last few days that have set okay?

Is there others that have not been set? Do you have a specific id of a code failing to set for this device?

[7/4/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Although we add the warning to the device, it would never be something that we use to prevent a code being set

SUMMARY: The customer reported a device conflict between two accounts, and the support rep clarified the issue, identifying the conflicting account. The customer deleted the conflicting account to resolve the issue and inquired if the device would now appear on the intended account or require re-adding.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/19/2025] CUSTOMER (Vladimir Pismennyy):
Hi team, for account `43629a13-3c93-4a50-926e-c3153b34ccea` we've got a warning `Some devices on this account are already connected to another account: f57f81cb-7be0-4738-be97-1f776cd5f4db`, but looks like we don't have access to account `f57f81cb-7be0-4738-be97-1f776cd5f4db` . Can you please check that case.

[6/19/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Hello. I had a look at this for you.

The device `f57f81cb-7be0-4738-be97-1f776cd5f4db` is connected here although it is currently marked as unmanaged: <https://console.seam.co/workspaces/bc1cf708-f664-499f-9c09-4faa0dc6fef6/connected_accounts/9aa47bef-8475-4924-bd24-ee424423beb1>

[6/19/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
`f57f81cb-7be0-4738-be97-1f776cd5f4db` is the ID of the device connected to another account rather than the ID of the account it is connected to

[6/20/2025] CUSTOMER (Emilio):
thanks <@U0665SWKXPH|Chris>, although client states the lock is currently under <mailto:info@ep-mg.com|info@ep-mg.com> (`43629a13-3c93-4a50-926e-c3153b34ccea`), can this be fixed from Seam or does client have to take any specific action from their side?

[6/23/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
You could potentially delete this account - <https://console.seam.co/workspaces/bc1cf708-f664-499f-9c09-4faa0dc6fef6/connected_accounts/9aa47bef-8475-4924-bd24-ee424423beb1>

Is it still being used for anything? It's the other account this is conflicting with, essentially :slightly_smiling_face:

[6/23/2025] CUSTOMER (Emilio):
not as far as I know, I deleted it now to prevent further conflict. Would this get the lock "R12 Front Entrance" to show on the other account <mailto:info@ep-mg.com|info@ep-mg.com> or would it need to refreshed/re-added?

Hey <@U05H38QKSJK|Bancy>, do you know from the host when they attempted to update the code? I am seeing successful updates have gone through on that device (including today), so this might have just been a temporary issue.

[7/2/2025] CUSTOMER (Bancy):
let me check the exact time  but it was on Sat 28th. but it doesn't appear to be temporary as this has been an ongoing issue for them. Everytime they attempt to change the start end time it fails

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/13/2025] SUPPORT (Sy Bohy):
<@UABC28MEZ|Maria> we have a couple of manufacturers interested in doing co-marketing that would promote the compatibility of their devices with software application. We're looking to do a small pilot/experiment on this and I thought Hostaway could be a good fit since we had discussed something like this in the past.

Do you know if (a) this is something Hostaway would still be interested in and (b) who the best person at Hostaway might be to discuss this?

We've tried some comarketing with Yale & Schlage before, whom are the biggest ones, and they haven't been super effective to be honest. <@U012TSFGM5M|Sy Bohy> do you have any information on what kind of promotion they'd support it with?  The other issue we've encountered is that the manufacturers tend to be quite regional, which limits the scope

[6/18/2025] SUPPORT (Sy Bohy):
<@U053CK7JCRJ|Alex Huras> thank you for the response! I was not aware that you guys had already done co-marketing. Do you have some details on what was attempted. With respect to what they have in mind, let me follow a bit later once i have some better details

[6/19/2025] CUSTOMER (Alex Huras):
<@U012TSFGM5M|Sy Bohy>
1. *March 2024* partnered with IglooHome for 20% of their locks (Europe only). Redemption was quite low, and we didn't bother to revisit.
2. *June 2024* we partnered with Shlage for 65% off their smart locks (for North America only). It turns out they went through a distributor for offer redemption, which marked up their smart locks by 100%, an our leads/customers quickly caught on that this wasn't a promotion at all. Some were pretty angry

i mispoke - we never had an offer for Yale, however we did run a co-marketing <https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hostaway_no-keys-no-stress-hostaway-is-proud-activity-7320794021403000832-V04K/|launch campaign for their European division> (which we were told needed to be separate from their North American operations, run by a different company)

[7/7/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Looking to this

[7/7/2025] CUSTOMER (Bohdan Rutylo):
any news?

[7/7/2025] CUSTOMER (Bohdan Rutylo):
User said they haven't touched anything on their end

[7/7/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@UBNKULUJZ|Bohdan Rutylo> We figured out what’s going on here but in order to push out a full fix we need the August team to update the information their API is sending us. We are in contact with their team and will follow-up as soon as we have more.

[7/7/2025] CUSTOMER (Bohdan Rutylo):
Do you have ETA for a fix? User is escalating this, as his reservations affected.

[7/7/2025] CUSTOMER (Bohdan Rutylo):
Does the issue affecting other accounts?

[7/7/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@UBNKULUJZ|Bohdan Rutylo> We did a manual job to move them out of the `removed` state, I just checked that account and all of the locks appear to be reporting online/offline as normal. TBD on the ETA for a fix as it's dependent on August.

[7/8/2025] CUSTOMER (Bohdan Rutylo):
thanks!
it's only single case of the issue?

TITLE: Request for contract details to plan customer charges
CUSTOMER: Wodify
WORKSPACE ID: Not specified
ASSIGNED TO: Jack Finley
TAGS: res: business ops
CREATED: 5/7/2025
CLOSED: 7/14/2025

SUMMARY: The customer inquired about pricing and billing details for Seam's managed devices and systems, including distinctions between the two categories, and confirmed the $5k annual platform fee and monthly device charges. The support rep clarified pricing, device management states, and billing for active devices, and the customer discussed integrating Seam's API with their UI for device management.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[5/7/2025] CUSTOMER (Mark Beach):
<!here> hey Seam team, as we are moving through the poc, we want to start lookin at how we are going to charge our customers through wodify for their access to seam. Can someone drop our contract in here so we have the numbers / can plan how we want to charge!

[5/7/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
This message was deleted.

[5/7/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U018QCTSLS2|Mark Beach>, our pay-as-you-go order form is attached below. It's a flat $10/device/month for smart locks and $90/system/month for access control systems. Sounds like Wodify's use case will just be locks. We also offer volume discounts with a prepayment that will drop the price lower, so let me know if you want to explore that. Lastly, we charge a $5k platform fee to launch into production, that is yearly recurring.

Let me know if you have any questions here!

[5/8/2025] CUSTOMER (Mark Beach):
Thanks!

[5/16/2025] CUSTOMER (Mark Beach):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> to confirm, are all Managed Device Types $10 per month? Or just Locks? What it the pricing for a single thermostat, camera, other smart devices etc?

[5/16/2025] CUSTOMER (Mark Beach):
Also, is a single turnstile or push bar a managed device, or does that begin to fall under the managed systems category? How can we tell where the line is drawn between the 2 options here?

[5/17/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U018QCTSLS2|Mark Beach> Yes, all managed devices would be that $10 price - locks, thermostats, sensors.

Any device connected to the API would be in the managed device category. For example, if you have a Lock connected to a turnstile (punch in PIN to reader, turnstile opens), only the Lock would be charged as Seam isn't actively managing the turnstile.

*Managed devices* = standalone locks, thermostats, sensors (i.e. Yale, Igloo, Ecobee) - those are connected to through the Device API.
*Managed systems* = full-blown access control systems that connect devices around an entire property in a centralized system (i.e. SaltoKS or Salto Space) - those are connected through the <https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/access-systems|ACS API>.

Does that make sense?

[5/19/2025] CUSTOMER (Mark Beach):
ok, so it matters where the access is granted? If Wodify is deciding yes / no this client can open the door, or if the lock itself has that info, then its a managed device?

whereas is the access data is stored in a centralized acs, then its the managed system?

[5/20/2025] CUSTOMER (Mark Beach):
so is the igloo bridge an access control system: <https://www.igloohome.co/en-US/products/bridge>?

[5/20/2025] CUSTOMER (Mark Beach):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> Also, just wanted to confirm: We will be billed the 5k in advance once a year, and then we will pay monthly based on devices in the account each month?
Or do we pay at the end of the year for the previous year’s usage?

[5/20/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
&gt; ok, so it matters where the access is granted? If Wodify is deciding yes / no this client can open the door, or if the lock itself has that info, then its a managed device?
I am not totally sure what you mean by this to be honest. The credentials you create are ultimately deciding yes / no to open the door. For Managed Devices, this is generally PIN codes and Remote Unlock. For Managed Systems, this is generally Mobile Keys, Physical Fobs and/or PIN Codes.

&gt; whereas is the access data is stored in a centralized acs, then its the managed system?
Yes, this is correct. if the access data for a location is stored all in a centralized acs that controls the devices around the property, its a managed system.

Igloo locks are managed devices. The bridge is an accessory piece to hook up to the lock for Wifi Connectivity, but it isn't billed as a 2nd device because Seam isn't controlling it through API.

An easy way to quickly determine between the two - Is it a smart lock brand (Yale, Igloo, August, Schlage)? Yes: *Managed Device*

[5/20/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
&gt; We will be billed the 5k in advance once a year, and then we will pay monthly based on devices in the account each month?
Yes, that is correct! It's a one-time payment we'd charge when you launch fully to production and yearly recurring thereafter. You'll then be charged month-to-month based on usage.

[5/21/2025] CUSTOMER (Mark Beach):
thanks <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> - and is it just “Active” devices, or do inactive / deactiaved devices that still live in the workspace also affect the monthly bill?

[5/22/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U018QCTSLS2|Mark Beach> For devices, it's just those in a `managed` state. Seam has the concept of <https://docs.seam.co/latest/core-concepts/devices/managed-and-unmanaged-devices#convert-a-managed-device-to-unmanaged|managed/unmanaged devices> - managed meaning they are actively being controlled through the API. If your customer has a device that they no longer will be using, you can call the `seam.devices.update` endpoint to <https://docs.seam.co/latest/core-concepts/devices/managed-and-unmanaged-devices#convert-a-managed-device-to-unmanaged|unmanage> it. That said, if a device is an a `managed` state for any period in a month (i.e. 1 hour), it will be included in the monthly bill.

[6/2/2025] CUSTOMER (Mark Beach):
<@U02P77QG5H6|Jeff O’Malley> would this manage devices api make sense given the ui? Or would our customers just need to hit a button on the ui component we’ve embedded to “unamange” the device

[6/2/2025] CUSTOMER (Jeff O’Malley):
I'm not sure - let see what the current Seam designs look like

SUMMARY: The customer reported issues with Honeywell thermostats where daily programs were overriding schedules and presets, causing incorrect temperature settings. The support team acknowledged the problem, worked on a fix, and eventually deployed it, resolving the issue.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/24/2025] CUSTOMER (Kris):
Hi team :wave: We’ve been seeing issues with Honeywell thermostats. There is a new Programs section and instead of our schedules and presets, those programs are active. I’m guessing those are overriding our schedules. What is that feature exactly? How can it be turned off, we need to recommend something to our users.

[6/24/2025] SUPPORT (Pawel Stepniak):
Hey <@U01UKQFA8LA|Kris>,
sorry, but there's currently no way to turn daily programs of as we didn't anticipate it would impact existing schedules. We're trying to get this resolved asap

[6/24/2025] SUPPORT (Unknown):
Paweł Stępniak created a high priority issue SHD-1468 Make sure `daily_programs` don't override user's climate presets

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (Kris):
<@U05UGTTRJ8Y|Pawel Stepniak> What would happen if we were to just delete the daily program?

[6/25/2025] SUPPORT (Pawel Stepniak):
I'll confirm this 100% but from my knowledge, they would just get pulled back in 15 minutes

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (Tim Parry):
<@U05UGTTRJ8Y|Pawel Stepniak> Any update here? Concerned on the number of thermostats this is currently overriding. Looks like there's various programs on most(all?) thermostats that are overriding our presets.

[6/25/2025] SUPPORT (Pawel Stepniak):
<@U07JH4KMZHB|Tim Parry> sure, the update is that devices are getting updated with the schedule that you set them to. It is our reporting of the active climate setting that's incorrect. We're working on a fix and I'm sorry this takes so long.

[6/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Lisa Prins):
Hi <@U05UGTTRJ8Y|Pawel Stepniak> could we get any update on this one? :pray:

[6/27/2025] SUPPORT (Pawel Stepniak):
<@U01A5EL2M3N|Lisa Prins> sure, I'm fairly confident we should have a fix merged today. I'll let you know if I do (or don't for some reason)

[6/27/2025] SUPPORT (Pawel Stepniak):
Okay guys, real sorry about this but we haven't managed to get the fix in this week. I can assure you that the correct requests are being sent to the providers but we need to decouple some functionality from our thermostat status reporting and it's more complex than anticipated.
Once again real sorry about the whole situation. We have a partial fix and this thing's on top of our list for next week. I can hopefully bring the good news next time...

[7/1/2025] CUSTOMER (Tim Parry):
<@U05UGTTRJ8Y|Pawel Stepniak> Some of our devices are showing as 'away' in our UI. This is pulling from the daily programs, rather than our schedules & presets. Based on the temperatures this doesn't look to be just visual.

Any eta on a fix here? This is starting to cause quite a few issues for our users

[7/1/2025] SUPPORT (Pawel Stepniak):
<@U07JH4KMZHB|Tim Parry>, I realise it's been a while, we're working on a fix right now. Can you post the device ids and I'll check what we're sending to the provider and the current settings?

[7/1/2025] CUSTOMER (Tim Parry):
Here's the Device ID: 7c11b349-c403-4030-9002-b4ca328eb608

[7/1/2025] SUPPORT (Pawel Stepniak):
I can see it is set to `hospitable-unoccupied`  and the thermostat reports desiredHeat 55 and desiredCool 75. I think that's correct?

[7/1/2025] CUSTOMER (Tim Parry):
That's correct, although I'm a little confused on whether this is just a visual UI problem or not. This user reached out to Ecobee directly. Ecobee told the user Seam were overriding the actual temperatures, not just the display. & This hosts' guests woke up in the night due to the temperature rising in the property. Is there anyway to validate for sure if the temperatures are being overridden or not?

[7/1/2025] SUPPORT (Pawel Stepniak):
The desiredHeat 55 and desiredCool 75 are values I took from Ecobee's response when polling the thermostat but right now I can no longer find the device. Did you guys remove it?

[7/1/2025] CUSTOMER (Tim Parry):
Yeah that was the correct preset, so strange on the temperature increasing. The user has disconnected the device now until resolved

[7/1/2025] CUSTOMER (Devon Mather):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> this was what I anecdotally brought up in last weeks sync ^ cc <@U0665SWKXPH|Chris> <@U012TSERYA3|Dawn Ho> <@U066W71LB7F|Charles>

TITLE: Questions on API access code creation and update process
CUSTOMER: Vacasa
WORKSPACE ID: Not specified
ASSIGNED TO: Jack Finley
TAGS: res: waiting for response, res: directed to existing docs
CREATED: 4/30/2025
CLOSED: 7/9/2025

SUMMARY: The customer sought clarification on API processes for creating and updating access codes, including handling online and offline locks. The support reps explained that deprecated `action_attempt` properties should not be used, clarified the polling method and webhook events for status updates, and addressed discrepancies between SDK and API responses. The customer highlighted issues with offline lock code delays and `unset` statuses for both online and offline codes. The reps confirmed that offline codes should be instantaneous but may experience slight delays due to vendor server responsiveness, and online codes remain `unset` until the `starts_at` time. The customer plans to discuss internally how to handle these scenarios.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[4/30/2025] CUSTOMER (Bret Hodge):
Hi All - had a few questions on the create/update codes process with the API.

For creating an <https://docs.seam.co/latest/api/access_codes/create|access code> the API gives some details on the properties but looking for some clarity on a few of them.
• based on the presentation it looks like really all we need to create a code for online is *device_id*, *starts_at*, *ends_at *and thats it?  Everything else would be optional.  Any recommendations of using any other optional properties with our calls?  We basically want the system to create the code and not have to send in a specific code to use.
• *name *- if we pass a value for this if we have multiple calls with the same name is there any issue? 
• *sync *- no description on what this means? Sync to what? I'd assume for online locks the codes would always sync so does this represent something else?
• *is_offline_access_code - *for offline locks like this is the only property we need to set to true, correct (based on presentation)?  If so, what are these for?
    • *use_offline_access_code* 
    • *attempt_for_offline_device *

As far as the result to creating an access code. Looks like we get an action attempt id back and by default it starts as pending.  How long do these requests normally take?  Our processes are typically not asynchronous, some service requests a code and expects one in return.  If we verify the lock is online with get device should this be something we can verify works immediately?

I think that's it for now, everything was pretty straight forward and didn't have any issues implementing your APIs.

[5/1/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U01TH7118BH|Bret Hodge>, glad to hear things have been straight forward so far. Answers below:

• That's correct - `device_id` is the only parameter that is required, and if you're creating a `time-bound` code you'll need the `starts_at` / `ends_at` stamps as well. I would strongly recommend setting the `use_backup_access_code_pool` true when creating codes to utilize the backup code functionality. If you want users to be able to modify the codes in their provider app for whatever reason, you can also set the `allow_external_modification` flag to True. When a guest does that, Seam send a `access_code.modified_external_to_seam` event warning you.
• I would recommend not creating many codes all with the same name, if possible. Some locks will have logic that reject the code creation/setting if there is an existing code on the lock with the same name, so it could cause issues.
• `sync` has been deprecated and is being removed from the docs, so you can ignore it.
• `use_offline_access_code`* *should be set to true when creating an offline code, this creates a special type of "code" that isn't really a code but an algoPIN.
• `attempt_for_offline_device`should be set to true if you want Seam to keep trying to set the code on a device that might be temporarily offline. 
• It should normally only take a second or two to receive a `success` request back when creating an access code if the device is online and responsive. However, actual time can vary depending on network conditions and state of the device. The SDK has a `wait_for_action_attempt` <https://pypi.org/project/seam/|option> that your system could continuously poll up to a point until you get a success response. 

Let me know if you have any follow-up questions here!

[5/1/2025] CUSTOMER (Bret Hodge):
Thanks for the quick response.  We are actually using node, not python.  Looks like a similar property exists for that <https://github.com/seamapi/javascript-http?tab=readme-ov-file#action-attempts|waitForActionAttempt>.  I'm currently not using the the npm package due to some error handling processes we have automated around API requests within our app and your APIs are pretty straight forward.  I can handle the polling myself, but will look into using the npm package as well and adding wrappers around it for error handling.

Our standard process is not to require guests to have to use 3rd party apps/tools to get in to the home.  So we wouldn't be using the external modification as of yet) but good to know!

Can you describe a bit more on how backup access codes work?  I see the documentation <https://docs.seam.co/latest/api/access_codes/pull_backup_access_code|here> and see the property as an option on <https://docs.seam.co/latest/api/access_codes/create|creating an access code>, but not sure how/why they would differ from making a standard time bound request.  It says they work immediately, does that mean they don't honor the starting time?

[5/5/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U01TH7118BH|Bret Hodge> Sorry for the slight delay here - that sounds good on the action polling and external modification points.

Regarding the backup code piece - when Seam programs your original code, it will put a few more on there as “backup” in a pool. Yes, the original starting/ending time is honored. By working “immedaitely”, it means that the backup code will be matched exactly to the starts_at/ends_at timestamps of the original code, so there should no additional edits that need to be made.

The use case is to avoid customers getting to the door where the code doesn’t work and they’re locked out. When Seam notices any issues with the original programming of the code on the door, we’ll fire off an `access_code.failed_to_set_on_device` and you can build in logic to then pull a backup code to use (image attached to show this in practice).

[5/15/2025] CUSTOMER (Bret Hodge):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> I've got our API implementation done and tested with some August locks on a few scenarios and things seem to be working fine.  I'm currently not using backup codes because if I understand the process correctly, that doesn't really fit with any of our internal processes.  If someone gets to a home and the code doesn't work we either generate a new code for them or to avoid any further issues and give access to the home via other means (lockbox with key for example).  So we wouldn't have a process to look up a backup code when the original one failed even if I used them to create the code (unless I'm misunderstanding how that process works).

I did have a few questions about testing the implementation:
• how can I test my process when a lock is offline?  Are there any test accounts that have an online lock but it is set to offline?
• Is there a process where I can test offline locks?  The only one I know off the top of my head that might be offline in your test accounts is <https://docs.seam.co/latest/developer-tools/sandbox-and-sample-data/dormakaba-oracode-sample-data|dormakaba>.  However, when I tried to add a test account, I'm not seeing that brand listed in the available locks.  Is there another vendor with a test account I can use?
• Are there any vendors you suggest testing or will testing an online vendor and offline vendor be enough?  Just making sure I cover all the potential scenarios.

Along the lines of online/offline.  Can you verify my logic check.  I didn't see anything that exclusively said if a lock was internet connected (online) vs offline.  So I'm doing:
• to determine if lock is online I'm checking `properties.online` is true and `can_program_online_access_codes` is true. If the device is offline we abort and try again later.
• for offline locks i'm checking `can_program_offline_access_codes` is true. 

I am setting the access code request property `is_offline_access_code` equal to `can_program_offline_access_codes` when making the request in both instances.

One thing I'm not sure about is if a lock that is connected to the internet but is currently "offline" would `can_program_offline_access_codes` ever be true here?  If so, is there
• a property I can reference to determine if a lock is truly an offline lock (or the inverse an online lock)
• if I can program an online lock when it's offline how does that work?  Would the action attempt never complete until the lock comes back online?

Thanks in advance!

[5/19/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U01TH7118BH|Bret Hodge>, regarding backup codes, the use case with these codes is you would have some already provisioned on the lock to give to the user in case the original one fails to set. With your planned process, immedaitely creating a new code might not fix the problem because the issues might be on the lock itself, not the code. But with a backup code already loaded on there, it wouldn't matter. Does that make sense?

Testing questions:
• You can use the Igloohome sandbox account, it has a default Offline lock that you can use for testing - credentials <https://docs.seam.co/latest/developer-tools/sandbox-and-sample-data/igloohome-sample-data|here>.
• As a general rule, I would focus testing on Yale, Schlage, and August as that will probably be the main brands you'll see. that said, I would focus on what brands are most popular with your customers if you have that information. Doing testing on offline/online locks is great as well!

Online/Offline questions:
• That's correct - for checking general device connectivity status, you should check `properties.online`. and and then can check the capability flags (`can_program_online_access_codes`& `can_program_offline_access_codes`) to see if the device can currently program codes.
&gt; One thing I'm not sure about is if a lock that is connected to the internet but is currently "offline" would `can_program_offline_access_codes` ever be true here?
This could happen, but it would be rare/unexpected. Fundamentally, if a lock is connected to the internet I would expect Seam to reflect that in its status. As noted above, the best property to check what the true status is would be the `properties.online` flag. And yes, if you sent a create code request to an online lock that in its current state is offline, Seam will hold the job and wait to program the code will the lock comes back online.

Does this help? Let me know if I answer any other questions!

[5/20/2025] CUSTOMER (Bret Hodge):
Thanks <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> for the offline testing account.  I'll work on testing that today or tomorrow.

As far as the online/offline what I was trying to get at is if there is a way to know if the lock has online functionality vs a lock that is completely offline.  The reason is if the lock is capable of being online but is currently offline we do not want to try to generate a code.  Is there a way to know if a lock is only capable of offline code generation vs an online capable lock that happens to be offline?

As far as backup codes goes, I guess I'm still a little confused on how that works.  If back up codes only work for the specified time, it would mean they would have to be "programmed" on the lock as well after our request, correct?  If so, why would the original code generated not work whereas a backup code would?

In any event, we don't have a current flow for flagging a code as invalid and having a "backup" code for a stay.  If a code doesn't work the support specialist as a few options:
• generate a new one and see if it works.  In this case if the lock is offline it would fail and they would fall back to another option.
• give out a code that is known to work (not necessarily related to the stay) and then remove the code after the stay.
• give access via a lockbox with a physical key

We could look into a new process to leverage backup codes but it would require a change to the existing flow that services don't currently handle vs what we are doing now on updating an existing api to accept a seam provided lock.

[5/20/2025] CUSTOMER (Bret Hodge):
Looking at the offline lock device data looks like there is a property called `online_access_codes_enabled`.  Would this be a way to know if it was an online capable lock and to include that property with the `online` and `can_program_online_access_codes` properties? Or would it ever be false for an online lock?

[5/20/2025] CUSTOMER (Bret Hodge):
I'm testing my offline lock flow and it appears that you do not send the code back with the request, is that correct?  I was getting null back for the code and based on <https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes/offline-access-codes#brand-specific-offline-access-code-restrictions|the offline access codes page>, it looks like we do not get a code generated until close to usage time, is that accurate?

Is there no way to force the system to generate the code immediately?  If not, the documentation just says when the starts_at time approaches it will create it.  What time frame are we talking about? How soon will a code be generated before the starts_at time?

[5/22/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U01TH7118BH|Bret Hodge> Sorry for the delay here, answers below:

The reason is if the lock is capable of being online but is currently offline we do not want to try to generate a code. Is there a way to know if a lock is only capable of offline code generation vs an online capable lock that happens to be offline?
Ah I see - yes if there's a online lock that in its current state is offline, `can_program_online_access_codes` should still be `true`. So if that flag is `true` and the `online` property is false, its an _online_ lock that just happens to be offline. If `can_program_offline_access_codes` = true, then that would be a lock that can program offline codes. `online_access_codes_enabled` is an obsolete property and should be ignored.

&gt; As far as backup codes goes, I guess I'm still a little confused on how that works.  If back up codes only work for the specified time, it would mean they would have to be "programmed" on the lock as well after our request, correct?

• give out a code that is known to work (not necessarily related to the stay) and then remove the code after the stay.
• give access via a lockbox with a physical key
I understand your point - I followed up with our dev team and they said that if the backup flag is enabled on the code creation request, Seam will immedaitely program a backup code on the lock when the create command issued, even if the reservation is days out and the code won't be set until then. So in that scenario where the code fails to set at the `starts_at` time, you should have a backup code already on there, "hidden" and ready to be pulled from the pool. When you pull it, Seam will match the code's time windows to the original code, and it will be automatically deleted at the `ends_at`. The backup code would have have its own `access_code_id`. Ultimately, up to you if you'll want to implement this!

I would expect the code to come back almost immediately :thinking_face:, I did some testing on our offline lock and I was able to see the code a second or two after creating it. In my image below you'll see I am seeing the `407105053` code even though the reservation is days out.

[5/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Bret Hodge):
Thanks for the clarification on the online/offline  properties and backup code process.

As far as testing the offline access code and me not getting a code back during testing, I went back and pulled the access attempt ids from testing last week and they do now have a value.  However, if I create a new one now, I'm getting null for the code.
Example create request:
```{
  "device_id": "f2902b06-c0b9-4e35-8349-f77de878ecbe",
  "name": "bret test 4",
  "starts_at": "2025-08-01T16:00:00Z",
  "ends_at": "2025-08-02T16:00:00Z",
  "is_offline_access_code": true
}```
And this was the response:
```{
    "action_attempt": {
        "status": "pending",
        "action_type": "CREATE_ACCESS_CODE",
        "action_attempt_id": "7dc98e81-136e-41d1-986c-28f9e7a1a03a",

What I noticed during testing was if I didn't put `is_offline_access_code=true` on the request, it immediately gave me a code but it was 4 digits so i think it was treating it as online and is trying to schedule a push to the lock.

[5/27/2025] SUPPORT (Evan):
Hi <@U01TH7118BH|Bret Hodge> I just wanted to jump in here and clarify something. I'm sorry this wasn't communicated directly to you earlier in case it's been a point of confusion.

The `action_attempt` in the responses returned by the `/access_codes/*` APIs are *all deprecated and will be removed*. They are only still returned by the API to ensure some very early customer applications are still supported.

The current Seam Docs should not be referencing those anywhere. Please let us know if you found any docs that still uses those so we can remove them. These docs should contain the latest guide on using the access code API without action attempts: <https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes/creating-access-codes>

[5/28/2025] CUSTOMER (Bret Hodge):
thanks <@U048JGPNGNS|Evan> Looks like the new method is to just request/pool the access code by id again and check the status value is `set` or look for any `warnings` or `errors` in the return based on the <https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes/creating-access-codes#polling-method|polling method>. Is that accurate?

I don't think I necessarily saw any documentation that told me to poll the action attempt as part of a flow. I just saw the api in both the <https://docs.seam.co/latest/api/action_attempts|postman collection> and <https://docs.seam.co/latest/api/action_attempts|api docs> and tested it out when the action action attempt on the access code create response.

I will note that I'm looking the latest api docs though (even the action attempt apis are linked on the side bar nav in your link) and there is no note of them being deprecated.  Additionally the <https://docs.seam.co/latest/api/access_codes/create#response|API docs for the create access code response> is referencing the action attempt id as well.

The documentation you pointed me to is using the npm package (I'm looking at the JS implementation) and it's response object is different than the API response object for the API call directly.  We are not using the npm package.  Is the API's response going to change to match the npm package's response for creating an access code or is it just removing the action attempt id property?  Right now, I don't see any versioning on the seam API.  Is there any way to force a specific version?  The url i'm using now for an API call to create access codes would be <https://connect.getseam.com/access_codes/create>

Thanks.

[5/28/2025] SUPPORT (Evan):
&gt; Looks like the new method is to just request/pool the access code by id ...

Yes, or you can listen for events instead of polling.

&gt; the action action attempt on the access code create response.

Yes, unfortunately there is no way to hide this. Although you did give me an idea, we should actually hide this for all new workspaces (or at least ones that were created after a certain date).

&gt; the postman collection

We do mark things as deprecated, however I think this is missing for top level response keys. Will look into this.

&gt; I will note that I'm looking the latest api docs though (even the action attempt apis are linked on the side bar nav in your link) and there is no note of them being deprecated. 

Action attempts are NOT deprecated :slightly_smiling_face: Just the ones returned by a few endpoint that _should_ all be removed from the docs at this point.

&gt; Additionally the API docs for the create access code response is referencing the action attempt id

Thanks! This is a very recent bug you just found with our new generated docs page. Will get this fixed ASAP!

[5/28/2025] SUPPORT (Evan):
&gt; The documentation you pointed me to is using the npm package (I'm looking at the JS implementation) and it's response object is different than the API response object for the API call directly. 

The SDK and API response shapes should be identical. All API endpoints return a single primary resource (or `void`). The SDKs always return the resource directly. For example,

`seam.accessCodes.create` will return `Promise&lt;AccessCode&gt;`

&gt; I don't see any versioning on the seam API.  Is there any way to force a specific version?

The Seam API is not versioned. In general any documented APIs are supported and stable to use. We do occasionally deprecate APIs or properties and work directly with our customers before removing them. Any undocumented APIs or properties are unsupported and may change at any time.

[5/28/2025] SUPPORT (Evan):
Can I ask what language you are developing in? We strongly recommend you use a Seam SDK for the best experience. I'd love to understand if using a Seam SDK is possible for your integration with Seam :slightly_smiling_face:

[5/29/2025] CUSTOMER (Bret Hodge):
&gt; Action attempts are NOT deprecated :slightly_smiling_face: Just the ones returned by a few endpoint that _should_ all be removed from the docs at this point.
Ah, good to know!

&gt; Can I ask what language you are developing in?
We use JS/node.  We are using the seam SDK for the connect view in helping our home owners connect their account to ours and allowing them to select the locks to add to their property in our system.  This was a new app/process with no existing infrastructure to tie into and the sdk made it very easy.

However, for our backbone service that generates codes for reservations/owners/housekeeping/etc internally, I did not use it because we have a system much like yours which integrates several 3rd party lock services (just not as many).  Because of this, our service has scaffolding around api requests and handles all the error handling based on a factory.  We could use the sdk but would require more work to customize our specific error handling around your sdk returns vs the direct API calls.  Since we only really need to get devices for an account and generate access codes, its basically just two API hits and no paging. So the API integration was quite simple for that specific use case.

&gt; The SDK and API response shapes should be identical.
If that's the case, then I shouldn't have to worry about discrepancies between the SDK and the API and can trust either source.  Looking at the response for the <https://docs.seam.co/latest/api/access_codes/create#response|create access code>, I see you updated the response to remove the old format.  However, the API still returns the old format.  While having extra properties that are deprecated aren't a problem, the return still doesn't match the SDK return for creating a code.

While I haven't used the SDK to generate a code, based on the <https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes/creating-access-codes#programming-an-ongoing-online-access-code|documentation>, the SDK returns the access code object at the top level (as in all the properties of an access code are at the top of the object) where the API returns the access code in a property called `access_code`.

&gt; Yes, or you can listen for events instead of polling.
Thanks for the confirmation. As to listening to events...our service does have webhook capabilities; however, not for access codes.  Internally, all systems expect a code when they request it.  So we either have to return it immediately or reject their request (in which case, the service will retry at a later date).  So polling is the only solution that works with our current setup.  I do agree webhooks would be amazing but the legacy infrastructure doesn't allow for it and the only way it could support it would be every internal service modifying their design/flow to accommodate it which isn't likely to happen (at least no time soon).

[5/29/2025] CUSTOMER (Bret Hodge):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> Just a reminder about offline lock response <https://vacasa.slack.com/archives/C08KVPH9Y7R/p1748384634210699?thread_ts=1746055637.243539&cid=C08KVPH9Y7R|here> with my example not providing a code in the response. Evan and I have been taking all the spotlight with geeky API talk :slightly_smiling_face:

[6/3/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U01TH7118BH|Bret Hodge> Apologies for the delay here! Regarding the best practice to grab the code for offline locks, I would recommend relying on our webhook events. You should be able to grab it in the `access_code.scheduled_on_device`event that Seam fires off shortly after creation. Example payload:

```{
  "code": "000006096",
  "device_id": "143a01b5-be59-41b6-831a-f7a33f159f30",
  "workspace_id": "82779690-858a-400f-94f1-9b6387f6ea0b",
  "access_code_id": "6fcdf27c-97d3-424a-9031-15948b09fc6d",
  "connected_account_id": "deedc8c8-e908-47a8-9e68-c8192b298cfa"
}```
In my testing Seam will fire this off almost immedaitely after the initial `access_code.created` event is sent. It's generally advised to rely on these events instead of polling the action attempt, as sometimes the lock could be experiencing issues that delay a proper action attempt response. In this instances, Seam will queue up the event and fire off once the lock returns to normal, so the events will still serve as the source of truth.

[6/5/2025] CUSTOMER (Bret Hodge):
hi <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> We cannot use the webhook method for grabbing the codes at this time. It just doesn't work with our flow. We have a webhook end point we can configure but it is used to monitor access/battery/etc and not to consume codes.  The way our process works, the calling service expects a code in the response and tying the webhook into the same API call is a messy situation.

In any event, confused on why this matters for offline locks; by offline locks I'm referring to locks that have zero networking capabilities (versus a lock that can connect but is simply offline at the moment of request).  With offline locks, to my knowledge, codes are generated based on a formula and have nothing to do with access to the lock since the lock has no networking capabilities.  These codes should be instant (outside of a delay to the vendor's API to generate) which is why I was surprised when no code came back with my request and still empty after asking for the code once it was in a "success" state.

Some of the confusion with offline locks was me looking at the action attempt. It was saying successful and I expect a code to be there and there isn't.  However the access code stage is still unset.  Based on the convo Evan, looks like action attempt is deprecated and I need to be looking at `stage` on the access code.

You can see this with my test <https://vacasa.slack.com/archives/C08KVPH9Y7R/p1748384634210699?thread_ts=1746055637.243539&cid=C08KVPH9Y7R|data here>.  But the question still remains, why the long delay in getting an offline code?  It's not immediately available (like within a minute even). Could this just be an issue with a test account or that vendor specifically (I was testing with the `Igloohome` sandbox test account's offline lock.)? Or will all offline locks have this long delay?

In addition, looking at your test of an <https://vacasa.slack.com/archives/C08KVPH9Y7R/p1747965073102549?thread_ts=1746055637.243539&cid=C08KVPH9Y7R|offline code in your screenshot>, the stage of that code is `unset` as well even though you have a code.  Does this mean that offline codes will always have an `unset` stage?

On the <https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes/offline-access-codes#id-2.-verify-successful-time-bound-code-registration|documentation> (2. Verify Successful Time-bound Code Registration). Each one of the numbered items confuses me a bit based on my experiences with offline locks:
• `Unset` - this line ends with `not yet available for use on the lock due to a configured future activation time`.  Offline codes aren't configured on the lock.  So why would an offline lock's access code ever be in an `unset` state?
• `Setting` - states `As the scheduled starts_at time approaches, Seam initiates the process of readying the code`. I think this is where my concern is.  It would appear to me that seam doesn't make a request for a code immediately but does it at an unknown future time prior to arrival. 
• `Set` - states `Upon successful programming`- similar to `unset` there is no programming on the lock.

My initial expectation with offline codes would have been a code immediately returned with a stage of `Set` considering the code is good and no programming on the lock is required. However, based on the documentation and my API testing I'm guessing that offline codes aren't immediately generated upon API request and rather seam generates the codes asynchronously on some interval/queue/etc and due to this we won't ever get an offline code with our API call in a timely fashion.  Does that sound accurate?

[6/15/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U01TH7118BH|Bret Hodge>, apologies for the delay here! Let me chat with our team tmrw and I'll follow-up to get you clarification - also happy to set up time with our Product Manager if you would prefer to chat through it.

[6/17/2025] CUSTOMER (Bret Hodge):
Thanks Jack, we might need to meet up to go over some of these things because I just retest online code creation and the `status` property we are suppose to check for completion is remaining `unset` as well (not just offline code request).  It's been over five minutes.  The access code id is `2c6b2e12-4c92-445e-8507-700587f745d7` and scheduled for start 8/1.

The `action_attempt` does complete though, but apparently this is deprecated and should not be used.  My action attempt id for this test is `6d8914f5-ca4c-41a3-a341-dd371ab4bb33`.

Based on documentation, <https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes/creating-access-codes#polling-method|polling> is a valid method for making sure the code is set, but from my testing the `status` property isn't changing in a reasonable amount of time from the initial request to be used in a synchronous process like we use.  I checked the troubleshooting <https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes/troubleshooting-access-code-issues|documentation> and there are no errors or warnings in the return.

I did find documentation on <https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes#native-scheduling|native scheduling> and it states that seam will load access codes 72 hours before starts_at.  The test lock was Yale which does support native scheduling. So my guess is that seam won't change the `status` value on an access code until 3 days prior to start date.  At which point seam will attempt to send the code to the lock and update `status` based on the result.

It looks like the only other way to generate codes is with <https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes#just-in-time-scheduling|just in time scheduling> which would only set the code 1 hour before start time.

Does that seem correct?  That might explain why my offline and online checks are still showing `unset`. My tests are in the future more than 4 days.

[6/17/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U01TH7118BH|Bret Hodge>, Seam will not change the status of the code to `set` until the `starts_at` time is reached (for offline and online) - so it's expected that your code scheduled for 8/1 is showing `unset`.

So for example, if a code is scheduled for July 1st @ 10am:

June 20th: Create code -&gt; success action attempt -&gt; code is in `unset` status
June 28th @ 10am (72hrs before): Seam does the preloading process, but we won't change the `status` or send any webhook events - this is just an extra bit of logic to ensure that it will be smooth sailing at the expected `starts_at` time.
July 1st @10am: Seam will now attempt to activate the code, and during this process the code will be in `setting` status. Expected time to set the code should only be a few seconds. Once done, Seam flips the code to `set`.

Let me know if this makes sense. I think it could still be a good call to set up time with our Product manager to address this and any pending questions.

[6/17/2025] CUSTOMER (Bret Hodge):
Yes, I understand your flow now.

Will have to talk internally how we want to handle. For online locks, we can just assume the code you return will work and go about the process as normal.  For offline locks though, what is the timeline for releasing a code?  Our processes expects a code returned so for online codes this is fine but offline if we don't get a code we won't be able to support these types of locks.

[6/18/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U01TH7118BH|Bret Hodge> Glad to hear that helped clear it up. For offline codes, it should be instantaneous but it's hard to give a definitive answer because even though it is an AlgoPin that already "exists" on the lock, to your point above we still need to receive it from the Igloo server. which depending on how responsive it's being, can lead to some slight delays.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[7/2/2025] CUSTOMER (Devon Mather):
We have an instance where a user is reporting that two of their devices went offline when we were still reporting 20% battery on it. When we check the logs this seems to be the case.

Lock in question is `b587f45c-ab24-4896-972e-378651b02c38`

Is there any chance there is a bug in your system that kept reporting the old value rather than reporting it was offline?

Additionally the lock went from 84% to 20% in a few hours which also seems strange

    • Max used this version "<https://pocket-deploy.simform.solutions/download?fileId=6abe994c-dd73-466c-a8f4-8b71e4051fc3>" and I'm not sure if it was fixed in the latest version. 
• On ios, holding the phone to the door for some reason triggers opening apple pay, you have to close out of it to continue unlocking. <@U05KH0LDLJH|Max Stoumen> is this an issue that Flamingo has to fix or an issue tha Seam has to fix or an issue that Latch has to fix?
• Cayley said Max mentioned being able to pass data to AVB/Latch regarding success/failure logs. <@U05KH0LDLJH|Max Stoumen> Is this possible? 
• To successfully unlock the door, your phone has to be just about touching the lock. <@U05KH0LDLJH|Max Stoumen> Is this an Latch issue? Or seam or Flamingo issue&gt;


[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Matt):
<@U01AN9J782C|Jude Chiy> the Apple Pay issue is something that can only be addressed in your app. You’ll need to request a special ‘com.apple.developer.passkit.pass-presentation-suppression’ entitlement from Apple for your app. I’ll write up the details and share them here later today. 

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Jude Chiy):
<@U01H7DV69PV|Parth Baraiya> I thought we already had suppression permission from Apple? This was done when we integrated Miwa.

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Parth Baraiya):
Yes <@URM5HV7FC>, We had that for only one app. I think we need to request it again. I can check that tomorrow and let you know if we need to do it again or not.

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Jude Chiy):
<@U01H7DV69PV|Parth Baraiya> Can we just layer it into app submission process since we have apps that have access control and some that don't and for the ones that don't, we can add them at different moments?

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Max Stoumen):
&gt; <@U01AN9J782C|Jude Chiy>  

&gt; Cayley said Max mentioned being able to pass data to AVB/Latch regarding success/failure logs. <@U05KH0LDLJH|Max Stoumen> Is this possible?

Yeah, if AVB is able to expose an endpoint to send the data to, success/failure events are provided by our SDK.

&gt;  To successfully unlock the door, your phone has to be just about touching the lock. <@U05KH0LDLJH|Max Stoumen> Is this an Latch issue? Or seam or Flamingo issue&gt;

This is a Latch issue, I haven't seen any configuration options on unlock distance in their SDK

Also here is a video of the unlock on Android, Cayley said it might be needed

<@U01H7DV69PV|Parth Baraiya> See above for Android

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Jude Chiy):
<@U05KH0LDLJH|Max Stoumen> On the Latch native app, does the user not have to be as close to the lock?

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Jude Chiy):
<@U01H7DV69PV|Parth Baraiya> Can you please respond about the freezing issue?

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Max Stoumen):
<@U01AN9J782C|Jude Chiy> We will test the native app to confirm it is the same distance in both :+1:

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Parth Baraiya):
I will check the freezing issue in android <@URM5HV7FC>.

<@U05KH0LDLJH|Max Stoumen> just to confirm, the issue is only in android right? for the iOS, this issue has been fixed.

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Max Stoumen):
<@U01H7DV69PV|Parth Baraiya> yes, android only

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Jude Chiy):
<@U01H7DV69PV|Parth Baraiya> I thought the freezing was fixed already?

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Parth Baraiya):
<@URM5HV7FC> I will check the requirements to get the approval for the passkit entitlement.

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Parth Baraiya):
<@URM5HV7FC> the freezing issue was fixed in iOS. right now, the implementation is native so, I might need to check this for android again.

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Jude Chiy):
<@U01H7DV69PV|Parth Baraiya> But why was it only fixed for ios?

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Parth Baraiya):
<@URM5HV7FC> as this is dependent on platform specific events, it was fixed for iOS only. I've mentioned earlier as well that the events fired by android and iOS are different. So, I have to check for different events for android and iOS. Right now, we have added the code to auto close the screen on success but it might not be working as expected. So, I have to check again.

I might need Seam's help to fix this. so, I might connect with them tomorrow.

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Parth Baraiya):
As for adding the passkit entitlement in regular release process, I need to check feasibility for that. Previous developers added that in only one app. So, there might be some additional checks done by apple before we can use this entitlement. But I will check again and confirm if we can add this in all the apps

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Parth Baraiya):
<@U01AN9J782C|Jude Chiy> I just checked, we will need to request permission from apple to  use passkit suppression entitlement in production app. And the permission is specific to the app. So, if we include this in all the apps, then we will have to request the permission for each app one by one. Also, this entitlement will be required only for apps using tap to unlock.

<@U05KH0LDLJH|Max Stoumen>  please let me if the android is working properly or not on e you've completed the testing.

[6/27/2025] SUPPORT (Max Stoumen):
<@U01H7DV69PV|Parth Baraiya> <@U088TR3TV7B|Collin> is testing this soon in the office

[6/29/2025] CUSTOMER (Parth Baraiya):
<@U05KH0LDLJH|Max Stoumen> <@U088TR3TV7B|Collin> is there any update in the testing?

[6/30/2025] CUSTOMER (Parth Baraiya):
<@U08H32F14Q6|Matt> for the pass suppression entitlement, after we add the entitlement, do I need to add code to manually suppress the Apple Pay before starting the unlock process? Or Seam will handle this?

cc: <@U02C0CDPFDG|Nikunj Vasani> <@U01AN9J782C|Jude Chiy>

[6/30/2025] SUPPORT (Max Stoumen):
<@U01H7DV69PV|Parth Baraiya> this is fixed!

[6/30/2025] SUPPORT (Max Stoumen):
<@U01H7DV69PV|Parth Baraiya> We are currently figuring out the best way to request pass suppression in the SDK (some users do not have this entitlement), so you will unfortunately have to add this manually for now

CUSTOMER: hostaway-seam

ASSIGNED TO: Jack Finley
TAGS: tri: needs bug fix
CREATED: 7/1/2025
CLOSED: 7/2/2025

SUMMARY: The customer inquired about viewing start/end times for removed codes in the portal and confirmed that the portal does not display such data. The support rep clarified that the original start time for the code was 2pm US-PST on 6/26 and explained that Hostaway must send an `UPDATE_ACCESS_CODE` command to update start/end times, even if the code is not scheduled. The customer acknowledged the need to contact their engineering team for further action.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[7/1/2025] CUSTOMER (Jose Colon):
Hi team,

The portal currently shows start/end times for active or unset codes, if I was looking for those times for a code already removed, is it visible anywhere in the portal?
Case: Arrival date was changed from 06-26 to 06-25 and I need to confirm what the start time was when it was scheduled. The lock has a bad connection, might be relevant.

Ex:
Device - 2dd19926-5cf5-44c4-9dce-ad58ee394881
Code - d6261443-93bd-49ef-b056-fc7f08fe838b

[7/1/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U05QQPNMC92|Jose Colon>, we currently don't show the starts/end times for deleted codes in the Seam Console. This is really to ensure that the user is only seeing upcoming or already active codes.

For that specific code, it looks like the `starts_at` time in the original creation was 2pm US-PST on 6/26.

[7/1/2025] CUSTOMER (Jose Colon):
Ah gotcha. Then yeah, it failed to update to 06-25. I believe Hostaway has to send Seam an `access_code.changed` event even if the code hasn't been scheduled to update start/end times?

[7/1/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
I see, yeah depending on when it was issued it might have failed due to disconnection issues. Hostaway will have to send Seam an `UPDATE_ACCESS_CODE` command to update the relevant code's start/end times.

[7/1/2025] CUSTOMER (Jose Colon):
To confirm, even if there weren't connection issues, Hostaway had to send "access_code.changed" to update the time _before the code was scheduled_?

If that's the case I have to contact engineering on my end.

[7/1/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
`access_code.changed` is an event that Seam sends back to Hostaway when you have updated a code. If you want to update a code, regardless if it's unset/set, yes you will need to issue an `UPDATE_ACCESS_CODE` command.

SUMMARY: The support team informed the customer about a new pagination feature in the PHP SDK and encouraged updating to version 2.77.0. The customer updated to version 2.80.1 but encountered issues, including errors with undefined properties and climate preset activation. The support team identified causes, such as expired tokens and nullable attributes, and is working on fixes while the customer awaits updates.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[4/10/2025] SUPPORT (Andrii Tymofieiev):
Hey <@U01UKQFA8LA|Kris> <@U07JH4KMZHB|Tim Parry>,
I wanted to update you on the changes we’ve made to the */connected_accounts/list* endpoint. We’ve now rolled out pagination to address the large response size issue that was causing server errors. With this update, you’ll need to update your integration to use the new pagination functionality in the PHP SDK.
In particular, the PHP SDK now provides a *createPaginator()* method that you should use instead of the old list() call. This new method returns a paginator object so you can easily process both the data and the pagination details. For example, you can use it like this (with a suggested limit of 250):
```$pages = $seam-&gt;createPaginator(
    fn($params) =&gt; $seam-&gt;connected_accounts-&gt;list(...$params),
    ["limit" =&gt; 250] // set a reasonable limit
);

[$connectedAccounts, $pagination] = $pages-&gt;firstPage();

if ($pagination-&gt;has_next_page) {
    [$moreConnectedAccounts] = $pages-&gt;nextPage($pagination-&gt;next_page_cursor);
}```
This approach returns both the connected accounts and the pagination object in one response, allowing you to fetch additional pages if necessary. We’ve temporarily set a higher default limit on the backend to avoid breaking existing consumers, but we strongly encourage you to update your integration and start using createPaginator() as soon as possible.
This functionality is now available in PHP SDK version *v2.77.0*. For more details on how to use pagination, please refer to the documentation here: <https://github.com/seamapi/php#pagination|Seam PHP SDK Pagination Documentation>.
Please let us know if you have any questions or need assistance with this update.

[4/21/2025] SUPPORT (Andrii Tymofieiev):
Hi <@U01UKQFA8LA|Kris>,
I wanted to check in on your progress with implementing pagination for the */connected_accounts/list* endpoint on your side. We’ve rolled out support in the PHP SDK (using *createPaginator()*, available in version *v2.77.0*) and temporarily raised the default backend limit to give you time to update without issues.
Could you please let me know when you expect to switch over to the new pagination approach? If you need any assistance or have questions about using *createPaginator()*, just let me know—I’m happy to help.

Hi <@U05THNTEPD2|Andrii Tymofieiev>, I'm currently wrapping up a bigger feature/fix for thermostats. As soon as that one is done, we're doing the SDK update. Probably either at the end of this week or early next week at the latest.

[4/30/2025] SUPPORT (Frank):
<@U01UKQFA8LA|Kris>, checking in on this again!

[5/1/2025] SUPPORT (Frank):
<@U01UKQFA8LA|Kris>, sorry for the repeated pings, but just hoping to close this out on our side as well!

[5/2/2025] CUSTOMER (Kris):
Hi <@U06AY2HQXFC|Frank> Not a problem, I was out of office yesterday. We pulled in the new SDK, broke a bit more things then expected, so it's going to take a bit to fix all the tests and verify everything before the merge to master. I will update you on the progress.

[5/5/2025] CUSTOMER (Kris):
Noticed the `$client-&gt;thermostats-&gt;get()` call was removed. We should now always use $`client-&gt;devices-&gt;get()` ? Is there a full SDK client changelog I can use to compare with the old version? I've fixed most of the things already but I want to be sure nothing is missed before we push to production.

[5/5/2025] SUPPORT (Pawel Stepniak):
<@U01UKQFA8LA|Kris> I can confirm `thermostats/get` is marked as deprecated and `/devices/get` is the way to go from now on. As for the changelog I can't think of anything of the top of my head but <@U06AY2HQXFC|Frank> might have some ideas. I'll try to find something useful as well, but LMK if this is need ASAP :thumbsup:

[5/6/2025] SUPPORT (Pawel Stepniak):
<@U01UKQFA8LA|Kris> could you provide which version of the PHP SDK you were using and the version you updated to? We'll generate something to help you and we'll also work on a way to automate this process to warn about changes like these in the future.

[5/6/2025] CUSTOMER (Kris):
<@U05UGTTRJ8Y|Pawel Stepniak> That would be nice. We're currently at `v2.62`

[5/6/2025] SUPPORT (Pawel Stepniak):

<@U01UKQFA8LA|Kris>, apologies for the multiple pings — just didn't want this to go stale!

[5/14/2025] SUPPORT (Andrii Balitskyi):
Hey <@U01UKQFA8LA|Kris>! Here’s a list of changes since v2.62 as discussed above. Let me know if you have any questions.

[6/5/2025] CUSTOMER (Kris):
Hi team :wave: We did the update to the SDK version 2.80.1 but noticed some issues when polling devices. When fetching a device using a devices client `$this-&gt;getClient()-&gt;devices-&gt;get($deviceId)` we were getting errors stating `Undefined property: stdClass::$created_at` . I assume these are SDK related? We also noticed you pushed a new version of the SDK yesterday evening but I don't see a fix for this one. We did a revert for now.

&gt; We also saw one other error when activating a climate preset?

Hey <@U07LZQ1RZNF|Devon Mather>! Sorry for the delay. I checked our logs and I found out that the climate preset activation failed due to expired access token. It should be refreshed now, could you try again?

[6/9/2025] CUSTOMER (Devon Mather):
Thanks for the update, I'll check it out! But what about <@U01UKQFA8LA|Kris>'s comment ETA for that?

[6/9/2025] SUPPORT (Andrii Balitskyi):
Yes, that’s unexpected since all devices coming from our API do have `created_at` defined. I was able to retrieve (`devices-&gt;get($deviceId)`) a device from my workspace using SDK version 2.80.1. Do you have the full error with the stack trace? Maybe it can give us some insight.

[6/9/2025] CUSTOMER (Kris):
<@U02TQKHU2G5|Andrii Balitskyi>

<@U07LZQ1RZNF|Devon Mather> and I traced it down to the errors object. It seems that the new SDK versions have created_at attribute in the error object set as non nullable and some devices don't have created_at set on all errors (check the last screenshot).

Working correctly: `7ee16dd8-66f2-408c-a436-067ed0fb39b4`
Not working:  `6ff8896c-df63-4ada-8eeb-7c116fadf703`

[6/9/2025] SUPPORT (Andrii Balitskyi):

TITLE: Inquiry about HID brand integration status
CUSTOMER: Gymdesk
WORKSPACE ID: Not specified
ASSIGNED TO: Jack Finley
TAGS: res: waiting for response
CREATED: 6/27/2025
CLOSED: 7/7/2025

SUMMARY: The customer inquired about HID integration, and the support team clarified that HID is typically just a card reader and integration is not required for unlocking doors connected to access control systems like Brivo or Genetec. The customer acknowledged and will gather more details.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Eran Galperin):
Hi team, the HID brand is listed on the device support page, but no devices are listed. Is this integration live yet or pending?

[6/27/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@UF6TGBUJC|Eran Galperin> Still pending, no live support yet. Are you seeing strong interest from customers for it?

[6/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Eran Galperin):
There's one customer with existing devices from HID and they're asking about support

[6/30/2025] SUPPORT (Sy Bohy):
<@UF6TGBUJC|Eran Galperin> it's a bit tricky to explain but HID is usually just the card reader. There should be a different access control system that the HID card readers connect to, such as Brivo or Genetec. Technically we can unlock doors connected to such systems without having to integrate with HID. If we want to do bluetooth keys or Wallet credentials, then we'd have to integrate HID

[6/30/2025] CUSTOMER (Eran Galperin):
Got it, let me get more details

[6/30/2025] SUPPORT (Sy Bohy):
thank you!

CREATED: 6/23/2025
CLOSED: 6/26/2025

SUMMARY: The customer reported failed attempts to unlock a device on June 22nd, providing action attempt IDs for investigation. The support rep identified the issue as an 'Invalid account token' error likely caused by a temporary provider issue, which self-resolved as subsequent actions were successful.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/23/2025] CUSTOMER (Bilal Khan):
Hey Team,

Can anyone help investigate a series of failed attempts to unlock this device: `47de6d96-4712-4067-ba42-165ceb2bcc57` on June 22nd, around 17:00 EDT?

Will post a few action_attempt_ids below:
`4c398fca-f11b-45f6-8c92-ec2973ac5d18`
`b45cdd8d-983a-4fe7-b681-335e520b08dd`
`badcfcbc-7e54-4354-8db5-a5eb01be06e5`
`b5f85fa2-3228-45b0-934f-073af8900e8c`

Possible issue with the provider perhaps?

[6/23/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U04H4ECKAAD|Bilal Khan> Looking at the logs for those actions, Seam showed the following error:

```  "stack": "InvalidAccountTokenError: Invalid account token\n
       ...
  "message": "Unknown error occurred (action_attempt_id: b5f85fa2-3228-45b0-934f-073af8900e8c)",
  "original_message": "Invalid account token"
}```
As I understand it, these errors can happen where there are short-lived issues on the provider end (i.e. Nuki), it looks like subsequent actions were successful so it appears to have self-resolved.

SUMMARY: The customer reported issues with a user not seeing locks after adding a provider account and ongoing codes failing to set on a specific lock due to a flaky internet connection. The support rep noted that recent codes were successfully set and suggested the customer recreate the codes to confirm if the issue is resolved.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/30/2025] CUSTOMER (orest):
Hello,

one of the users tries to connect locks but after successfully adding a provider account <https://console.seam.co/workspaces/d43c11d4-2641-4477-92e0-b49a1881ac3f/connected_accounts/1b0920a3-8e4e-4316-ad92-e35561c3062f> there is no locks displayed there. As he claims the lock that should be there is the Sense Smart Deadbolt with Century Trim. Could you check what is the issue here, please?

[6/30/2025] CUSTOMER (orest):
Hi,
all ongoing codes created by the user on the lock <https://console.seam.co/workspaces/d43c11d4-2641-4477-92e0-b49a1881ac3f/devices/be2f5a5d-c635-4615-ad86-f418ab7e496f> have failed. Could take a look please?

I see the error "August has acknowledged a request to program the code, but the access code has not yet been fully moved to the device. The device likely has a flaky internet connection. We will continue to try and set the code on the device." The strange part is that ongoing codes initiated by Guesty are set without any issues. Only the codes created by the user fail.

[6/30/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U028H1K7F7C|orest>, I see that there were failures to set codes on the lock on 6/24, and it appears that the device was having disconnections/flaky warnings at the time. That said, the last 2 codes have set successfully (`e02fa556-a18a-41c7-b208-9d5fd295f4d1` and `ccd211b7-9f9c-4f65-b2b5-00ce9ffa28df` ) - so wondering if this has resolved itself. Is it possible to ask your customer to re-create those codes and confirm if they can be set?

SUMMARY: A support rep initially misunderstood the setup requirements for a lock and requested it to be sent back for proper configuration with their system. The customer agreed, and the lock was shipped back with express shipping covered by the support team. The lock was reconfigured and prepared for return, with timing adjusted to accommodate the customer's travel schedule.

I got the unit (so this unit isnt attached to your sandbox to test this app yet ) does it need a app for it to somewhat communiate to the cloud

[5/15/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
It seems I have messed up a bit regarding this lock. I was incorrect in thinking that you would need your own system. Could you send the lock back to me, then I will set it up fully and send it back to you? This way you won't have to reach out to Salto to create your own demo instance for Salto Space. Sorry for this snafu, but the turnaround should be quick if you ship it to me today via fedex. After you receive the lock again, I can supply everything you need for testing. Sorry about this again, I misunderstood what was needed and what the locks were capable of.

[5/15/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
<@U0184N4V48L|Johnny> we will of course pay for your express shipping fees

[5/15/2025] CUSTOMER (Johnny):
copy that ya we can get that sent back i did contact the salto but he was out of office till friday too

[5/15/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
Gotcha. I was wrong in thinking that you wouldn’t be able to test without your own Salto Space system. Since this lock is going to “offline”, it just needs me to set it up with the system and then it will be functional even when it is physically hundreds of miles away from my space system

[5/15/2025] CUSTOMER (Johnny):
ahhh do i setup a separate system so you can tunnel into it without sending a different unit in the interim

[5/15/2025] CUSTOMER (Johnny):
i live on a mac so i gotta get my windows lab laptop out hehehe (we did that for honeywell stuff)

[5/15/2025] CUSTOMER (Johnny):
honeywell integration was alot of the really old ways on/off functional code lol

[5/15/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
I am saying that you can disregard the messages from me about you needing to set up your own Space system

[5/15/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
Once you send the lock back, I am going to set it up to be on our Space system and then I will send it back to you

[5/15/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
After that, you will be able to do testing with that device using that piece of hardware to verify your integration

[5/15/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
This way would be quicker than you communicating with Salto and setting up your own system and then putting that lock onto that system

[5/15/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
I should've set it up with our system initially, that's my bad

[5/15/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
Doing it this way still leaves the door open for you setting up your own Salto Space system in the future

[5/15/2025] CUSTOMER (Johnny):
thats cool thanks for that salto system i did get the inqury in it

to save time  you want me to port open dns/server IP allow  something to you so you dont have to go through sending back/forth and such or tunnel into your setup or does it phsycially ave to be near something to provision (but i could help that too with ya ) hehe im a lab junkie my self

[5/15/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
Unfortunately the only way to get that lock communicating with anything is by setting it up with the Salto PPD and the system locally installed. We will cover shipping costs and we will also send you it back with quick turn around

[5/15/2025] CUSTOMER (Johnny):
Kk ;)

[5/15/2025] SUPPORT (Forrest):
Express ship the hell out of that think, Johnny! We'll cover all the shipping costs :slightly_smiling_face:

[5/16/2025] CUSTOMER (Natasha):

[5/16/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
Actually I have the dimensions if you are going to use the same box i shipped it to y'all with

[5/16/2025] CUSTOMER (Natasha):

[7/3/2025] CUSTOMER (Bancy):
Hey Jack following up on this please

[7/3/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U05H38QKSJK|Bancy>, one thing our team wanted further clarity - do you know when the guest reported it stopped working? I see the this code was scheduled to go to `2025-06-22` .

Just to provide more color, I see the code was set on the device on `2025-06-17`, was used to unlock the lock all the way up until `2025-06-22`, and then was successfully deleted on the `2025-06-22`. So if it stopped working an hour or two before the ends_at time, it might have been a timezone issue.

[7/4/2025] CUSTOMER (Bancy):
They say on June 20 it stopped working according to them they had to have the guest use the physical key for the rest of the stay

[7/7/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U05H38QKSJK|Bancy> That is curious because the activity on the lock would seem to contradict that - we see multiple `lock.unlocked` events from the 21st and 22nd with that access code attached. I am not sure what else we can advise here.

[7/9/2025] CUSTOMER (Bancy):
Thanks Jack I will let them know should it happen again I will let you know

<@U07VCM0RBBM|Diego> <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley>, what is the latest Seam Android SDK version that we can use? We are upgrading our Kotlin version now, so we can use the latest SDK versions. Thanks
cc: <@U05KH0LDLJH|Max Stoumen>

[7/9/2025] SUPPORT (Diego):
<@U04FDN7D34K|Harley Lovitos> `1.9.70` is the most recent one. Let me know if you get into any trouble updating to this version. Note that it doesn't have the `_kotlin_1.7.0` part in the version name. It is just `1.9.70`

[7/9/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
can you try to use this package for seam

implementation("co.seam:seam-phone-sdk-android-core:1.9.79")
implementation("co.seam:seam-phone-sdk-android-saltospace:1.9.70")

Kindly check if that’s the correct package name and should we only use those two packages or we need more?

[7/9/2025] SUPPORT (Diego):
<@U04FDN7D34K|Harley Lovitos> the "core" version should be `1.9.70` , not `1.9.79` . Besides of that, it is correct (I tried it locally).

[7/9/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
Sorry that’s typo. Ok got it. I don’t need salto ks etc on this case since we are focus on salto space?

[7/9/2025] SUPPORT (Diego):
yes. That is correct. You only need core and saltospace

[7/9/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
Thanks Diego

CREATED: 7/8/2025
CLOSED: 7/9/2025

SUMMARY: The customer reported an issue with a Schedule access code that could not be modified. The support rep identified that the access code creation failed due to a duplicate code already existing on the device, and the conflicting code was added outside the system, preventing the new code from being applied. The customer acknowledged the explanation and thanked the support rep.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[7/8/2025] CUSTOMER (Lxd):
Hi, we have received feedback from a user regarding an issue with the Schedule access code. The picture shows the user viewing the valid time of the access code in the Schedule application. However, the start and end times of the access code creation are 2025-07-05T23:01:00Z-2025-07-07T18:00Z, and the user's time zone is America/Los Angeles (UTC-07:00) Los Angeles. There are some differences between the two, and the user cannot modify the start and end times of the access code in Schedule. Please help to investigate the specific reason. Thank you very much

[7/8/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Hello :wave:

Looking at our logs, I can see `46506a1c-2810-4dad-a51c-4a0e6e58344a` repeatedly failed to set with the error message:

```  "error_map": {

I'm struggling to see anything in our logs where we created the unmanaged access code with different times. From what I can see the only time we tried to create the access code was for the one in our system, and that failed due to the conflicting access code we detected already on this lock

[7/8/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Okay, so as per the grace period, the first time we would have tried to actually add this access code to the lock would have been 3 days before (2025-07-05T23:00:00+00:00 - 3 days)

Which we do have a record for:
```  "response": {
    "details": "Please check and correct all the errors and resubmit the request.",
    "errorCode": "AccessCodeValidationFailed",
    "errors": {
      "AccessCodeAlreadyInUse": "The requested access code is already in use on the device.",
      "AccessCodePatternMatch": "The entered code matches the pattern of an existing access code. Please enter a code where the first 4 digits do not match the first 4 digits of an existing code. Entered code: 1045. Existing code: 1045."
    },
    "producerId": "SchlageHomeAPI",
    "status": 400,
    "title": "Please check and correct all the errors and resubmit the request.",
    "type": "<https://api.allegion.com/errors/producers/SchlageHomeAPI/errorcodes/AccessCodeValidationFailed>"
  },```


So it looks as if the access code was added out with seam which is why our version we never able to apply

[7/8/2025] CUSTOMER (Lxd):
Okey, I got it

[7/8/2025] CUSTOMER (Lxd):

SUMMARY: The customer inquired about additional logs for a failed event on a specific device, and the support rep explained that intermittent connectivity issues with the lock caused the failure, which self-resolved shortly after. The rep noted the device has had recent connectivity problems.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/24/2025] CUSTOMER (Jose Colon):
Hi team, device `9a889f5a-3fff-4119-99b1-ed5e29041282`, accessCode `ab6cd3f6-8a56-4b5b-919f-94d6abb87748` .

Could you check if there were any additional logs for this failed to set event?

[6/24/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U05QQPNMC92|Jose Colon> Appears that it was intermittent connectivity issues with the lock at the time of setting that self-resolved shortly after. Typically when Seam fails to set a code, it means we're having trouble talking to the lock to complete the programming in a timely manner. Based on event logs, it appears this device has had some trouble staying connected recently.

ASSIGNED TO: Chris
TAGS: tri: needs bug fix
CREATED: 7/7/2025
CLOSED: 7/9/2025

SUMMARY: The customer reported a device issue with numerous active access codes without start/end times, potentially nearing its code limit. The support rep suggested the codes might have been queued during a device disconnection and recommended manually deleting them via the seam UI to resolve the issue.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[7/7/2025] CUSTOMER (Bilal Khan):
Hey Team,
Another strange issue, it seems this device `23a5173a-8982-40e5-a58f-297db7e177e5` has dozens of active access codes with no start/end time on it. Client is complaining that the device is close to reaching its maximum programmable codes and needs to delete some.

Can anyone investigate where these came from? It doesn't seem like they were generated by Enso, but perhaps there was some issue previously that generated all these codes.

The permanent access codes that should be on that device (from Enso) are the following
`5000b650-cc42-4757-81a1-51975a2f9202`
`5ab3c054-fc3e-44da-a3ed-e5cc9cf7ee94`
`fbff8933-2bc5-4c04-881b-cc1d53b3605e`
Then any temporary access codes are most likely Enso affiliated as well.

[7/7/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Hey. A lot of those codes were created over seven months ago so we most likely will not have verbose logs from this time. It looks like they were all created on 2024-12-17 through to 2024-12-20

The device was disconnected at the time so maybe you ended up queueing a lot of creation attempts? e.g.

```    "errors": [
      {
        "message": "Device Disconnected, you may need to reconnect the device.",
        "created_at": "2024-12-19T19:38:39.319Z",
        "error_code": "device_disconnected",
        "is_device_error": true
      }
    ],```

[7/7/2025] CUSTOMER (Bilal Khan):
hmm that could be the case

[7/7/2025] CUSTOMER (Bilal Khan):
I can investigate a bit more on ourside

[7/7/2025] CUSTOMER (Bilal Khan):
otherwise, if we just delete the codes manually through the seam UI, it should also be removed from the Schlager code limit right?

[7/7/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Yeah that's what I would recommend. If it's deleted via the seam console it will be deleted from the device too :slightly_smiling_face:

[6/4/2025] CUSTOMER (volodymyr.yatsyk):
Hi <@U06AY2HQXFC|Frank>,

Our pilot user has issues with Dormakaba lock.
Some of the codes generate as empty. This probably happens because there is already a code set for that time range and time slot.
Can you please confirm that?

And can you generate an error in case this happens rather than leaving the code empty.

[6/4/2025] CUSTOMER (volodymyr.yatsyk):
Hi Seam Team

It seams like issue with updating Kwikset access code times is back. <https://guesty.slack.com/archives/C04EY04BTJ4/p1743604050836299>
User has issues with it constantly.

Here is one of the examples
Code: `8c7d0b6e-b615-4a34-bfa2-a1d398a8891d`
Lock: `f526f1f8-8c84-4839-9101-73c97f52d4b1`

We updated starts at from `2025-05-26T19:00:00.000Z` to `2025-05-26T17:05:46.791Z`
But the code was set on device at `2025-05-26T19:00:12Z`

Can you please take a look?

I can provide more examples if needed.

[6/4/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U082WS4C1BJ|volodymyr.yatsyk>, can you elaborate a bit what the issue is here? If an update request was sent for the starts_at time to start at `2025-05-26T19:00:00.000Z`, then its expected behavior that the code would be set on the device at that time. Apologies if I am missing something.

[6/5/2025] CUSTOMER (volodymyr.yatsyk):
Hey <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley>
We updated starts_at to `2025-05-26T17:05:46.791Z` and it should've been set on this time.

[6/9/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Thanks <@U082WS4C1BJ|volodymyr.yatsyk>, I surfaced this to the team and am hopeful we can push it out a fix for this behavior by EoW

[6/17/2025] CUSTOMER (volodymyr.yatsyk):
Hi <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley>

Do you have any updates?

Here is another example
Code: `3bd8eb4a-24ad-4a33-ad45-613cd2e30390`
Lock: `51061415-2e53-4474-acd5-c909aafb7a5c`

Starts at changed from `2025-05-31T19:00:00.000Z` to `2025-05-31T15:00:00.000Z`
But the code was set on device at `2025-05-31T19:00:07Z`

[6/17/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U082WS4C1BJ|volodymyr.yatsyk>, sorry for the lack of follow-up. Our team hasn't been able to push out a fix for this Kwikset issue quite yet, i'll see what I can do to expedite it

[6/24/2025] CUSTOMER (volodymyr.yatsyk):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> Do you have an ETA for the fix. Cause client is pinging us about the issue.

[6/24/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U082WS4C1BJ|volodymyr.yatsyk> It is in code review right now, so hopefully it'll be live by EoD at the latest tomorrow.

SUMMARY: The customer inquired about integrating with Rhombus, a hardware provider, and the support team confirmed no current integration but agreed to explore the possibility. The customer clarified their interest in door unlocking functionality via Rhombus' access control, while noting that camera support was not relevant for their needs.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[4/28/2025] CUSTOMER (Jay Wilson):
Hi Seam team. Looking forward to working with you all! We had a partner ask if you'd integrate with Rhombus? I believe the answer is no, as they appear a competitive solution, but I wanted to confirm. Thanks!

[4/28/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U07NKUR6PFV|Jay Wilson>, correct, no integration with Rhombus currently. We don't get many requests for it so we aren't actively prioritizing it as of now - that can always change if we continue to get more customer interest.

[4/28/2025] CUSTOMER (Jay Wilson):
Thanks for the quick reply <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley>!  Are they essentially a competitor? That's interesting to me to hear that you would consider it

[4/28/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
I wouldn't consider them a direct competitor, per se, as they appear to be a hardware provider first. Do you know if they enable integrations to other brands through their API?

[4/28/2025] SUPPORT (Forrest):
<@U07NKUR6PFV|Jay Wilson> we've actually met with Rhombus a few times and they've considered implementing our API into their product. They manufacture cameras and have a platform to manage the camera feeds. I think they provide some mobile keys via third party integrations but it's limited. Maybe just Assa Abloy.

What's the functionality your partner is looking for?

[4/29/2025] CUSTOMER (Jay Wilson):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> <@U067F5HD4BX|Forrest> Thanks for the info! It's a payment processor AURIC, that was looking for a recommended solution, but we're going to push them to utilize our Seam integration going forward.

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (Jay Wilson):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> <@U067F5HD4BX|Forrest> Do you mind sharing the latest with respect to integrating with Rhombus? I've heard from a couple of our early customers, as well as ACT that they are highly regarded and compare well with Salto (with Salto often being higher priced).

[6/25/2025] SUPPORT (Sy Bohy):
<@U07NKUR6PFV|Jay Wilson> I don’t believe we have begun the integration process but I’ll have our BD function begin the process to see what it would entail

[6/25/2025] SUPPORT (Sy Bohy):
Would it be possible to also know the exact functionality you guys would need supported through this integration?

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Jay Wilson):
<@U012TSFGM5M|Sy Bohy> Thanks for the follow up! I'd have to understand the options better, but from my understanding of their products, we'd want the ability to unlock doors via their access control. I know they also have cameras, but I'm not sure how that would apply.

cc <@UF6TGBUJC|Eran Galperin> for perspective from a product standpoint.

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U07NKUR6PFV|Jay Wilson> Makes sense, we'll obviously need to scope the API but yes it'd be unlocking doors, probably via Mobile Credentials or Phyiscal Fobs (i.e. Keycards). We don't have camera support so Gymdesk wouldn't be able to leverage that through us (yet).

TITLE: Hey Team,

SUMMARY: A customer reported that their client reached the 50-user limit on Salto locks despite having only 9 devices. The support rep identified that some users in the system are unrelated to Seam and suggested either deleting non-essential users or contacting Salto to increase the user limit.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/19/2025] CUSTOMER (Bilal Khan):
Hey Team,

We have a client that is having issues with their salto locks and user limits (again)
Account ID: `2af27507-6921-458f-b772-4cb5b60766dd`

In this case, there's only about 9 locks in the account, but they've hit their 50 salto user limit already.
Can Seam confirm if these user are all for active lock codes? or rather if any of these can be deleted? My initial impression is that perhaps old users aren't being deleted properly, I could see it being the case that the combination of backup access codes, and codes for future bookings might be taking up all the space.

[6/24/2025] CUSTOMER (Clau):
Hi <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley>, do you have any update? :pray:

[6/24/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U04H4ECKAAD|Bilal Khan> <@U08EMFJ6KND|Clau>, sorry for the issues here. Yes, sounds like you know this but when you create an access code in Seam it creates a corresponding user in Salto. I looked into that device and am only counting 35 codes across their 9 devices, so am curious how they're at the 50 limit.

To your point, it might be that Seam is not adequately clearing out old users OR they have other users there for another reason that don't include Seam. The logical next thing to check would be codes (users) that are still still existing in your customers' KS system that aren't in Seam. Is it possible to ask your customer for a list of their existing users? I know that requires manual effort on their end, but not sure how else we can troubleshoot.

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (Clau):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> This are the users they reported last week

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Thanks <@U08EMFJ6KND|Clau> - in that last screenshot I see names of users that don't correspond to access code ids (i.e. Andrew Alexander), so I am assuming they have other non-Seam related users that are causing them to reach their cap of 50. Is it possible for them to delete any of those users?

[6/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Clau):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> Client said these are for the maintenance and housekeeping teams and they can’t delete those.

[6/27/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U08EMFJ6KND|Clau> Understood - under our implementation they will need to delete some codes from their devices OR reach out to Salto to increase their user subscription limit and allow more than 50 users.

CUSTOMER: Grata Technologies Inc.
WORKSPACE ID: Not specified
ASSIGNED TO: Max Stoumen
TAGS: None
CREATED: 6/26/2025
CLOSED: 7/4/2025

SUMMARY: The customer inquired about the behavior of the `/client_sessions/get_or_create` endpoint, noting it generates a new CST token each time, and sought clarification on token expiration and validation. The support team explained the endpoint's design, recommended using `/client_sessions/create` for their use case, and suggested storing session details for offline functionality. The customer proposed a new API endpoint for simplified token management, and the support team clarified the limitations of the current model while requesting more details to explore potential API updates.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
<@U05KH0LDLJH|Max Stoumen> <@U088TR3TV7B|Collin> API questions thread:

We are using the endpoint POST <https://connect.getseam.com/client_sessions/get_or_create|https://connect.getseam.com/client_sessions/get_or_create> to generate a CST, passing the user_identity_id in the payload. However, it seems to create a new CST token every time we call it. Is this the expected behavior? We noticed there's also a separate endpoint specifically for creating a CST.

Cc: <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> 

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Max Stoumen):
<@U04FDN7D34K|Harley Lovitos> that may be a bug, I can look into this and get back to you

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
<@U05KH0LDLJH|Max Stoumen> next question, if the token expires, does the EP generate new one or return the expired token?

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Max Stoumen):
<@U04FDN7D34K|Harley Lovitos> It is designed to generate a new one! Otherwise it would not be so useful :sweat_smile:

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
Great, just wanna confirm so we are sure that the ep is returning valid token and we will not do our own validation. Let me know if the bug is fixed for this EP so we can test.

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Phil):
you should proably do some of your own validation just in case there network issues and to support offline connectivity as well as save on requests

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
That make sense for the offline mode feature. We will save the CST and expiry date, not just the CST. Thanks Phil

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Evan):
Hi <@U04FDN7D34K|Harley Lovitos>

`/client_sessions/get_or_create` returns the same client session when using `user_identifier_key`. This behavior was originally designed as a convenience so API users would not need to store the `client_session_id`. This use case is mostly for users of Seam Components and not for your use case as I believe you do not use `user_identifier_key`.

For your use case, with `user_identity_id` and the Seam Mobile SDK, we recommend one client session per end-user session. e.g., when your user logs on and you issue them a session or refresh token, you can attach a client_session to the lifecycle of that session or token.

So you should use `/client_sessions/create` when a user logs in and store the ID with the session. Then use `/client_sessions/get` as needed. And `/client_sessions/update` if the session is extended, and `/client_sessions/delete` when the user logs out. I understand this is not well represented in our docs, and we will be improving that :slightly_smiling_face:

[6/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
This message was deleted.

[6/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
<@U048JGPNGNS|Evan>, can we introduce a new API EP for our use case? So we only call one EP, if we need a new token or if already exist it will return the current valid token. Thank you

[6/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
Question from our BE team

_I do have the _`_user_identity_key_`_. I just tested it on the user identity that has the key _`_sbounadja+ict.re22@grata.life_`_. It did not create a new CST token, but returned one: _`_seam_cst136vMZa2Z_8TSz6gUFJY7EFoYW7J52ZtbU_`_._
_However, this token does not match any of the four existing CST tokens associated with the user identity:_
• `seam_cst123jJEwP8_4bUKjDH4SjBiYXuiVfWupida`
• `seam_cst16geQPNyH_2DcntQFtbY63JHjQaD7HGJBT`
• `seam_cst12ptz798j_3HYN52Ua62rhSALnk7iJoq7C`
• `seam_cst12iGjyx6S_4nYUFpRRyjNw2Xzuyxjp6tRJ`
is the returned token would work fine?

[6/27/2025] SUPPORT (Evan):
&gt; So we only call one EP, if we need a new token or if already exist it will return the current valid token.

<@U04FDN7D34K|Harley Lovitos> This is the intention of `get_or_create` but that model really only makes sense with the way we developed this for Seam Components and `publishable_key` where the client session stores the state of the "owned accounts" 1to1 with an end user. This model does not apply user_identity.

Since a user identity can have multiple valid client sessions, there is no way to pick "the current valid token" since there may be any number of valid tokens. Can you help me better understand your use case and how it is different than the recommend approach I posted above? :slightly_smiling_face: Maybe we can make an API update that makes this simpler.

&gt; When your user logs on and you issue them a session or refresh token, you can attach a client_session to the lifecycle of that session or token.
&gt; So you should use /client_sessions/create when a user logs in and store the ID with the session. Then use /client_sessions/get as needed. And /client_sessions/update if the session is extended, and /client_sessions/delete when the user logs out. I understand this is not well represented in our docs, and we will be improving that

Should we be not selling Akiles here <@U05UGTTRJ8Y|Pawel Stepniak> 

[6/20/2025] SUPPORT (Sy Bohy):
Can we jump on a call directly with said customer and get to the bottom of it asap? We can’t afford to have folks complaining for weeks and not be crazy proactive about it. This is how churn happens

[6/20/2025] CUSTOMER (AJ):
<@U08B256BFA7|Felipe Alvarez> can you please help get this scheduled ASAP?

WORKSPACE ID: Not specified
ASSIGNED TO: Forrest
TAGS: res: directed to existing docs
CREATED: 6/5/2025
CLOSED: 7/10/2025

SUMMARY: The support team provided updates on API changes, including new flags for access method modes and live API reference documentation. They also mentioned improvements to the Android app and shared a mobile key link from their test environment, which the customer confirmed worked successfully.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/5/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
Hey <@U067F5HD4BX|Forrest>, just a quick question — do you happen to have plain REST API documentation for Insta Key?  Our backend is mostly Java/Kotlin, so calling a REST API would likely be easier for us than embedding an external NPM layer (e.g. in a Lambda). Thanks!

[6/5/2025] SUPPORT (Forrest):
<@U012TSERYA3|Dawn> <@U0775E12MJM|Phil>?

[6/5/2025] SUPPORT (Forrest):
Hey Peter! We should have those docs auto-generated, but it seems there is a bug for the instant key route.

We're working on resolving this and will let you know as soon as it is working again.

[6/5/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
Thanks that's great. We won't be able to start before next week anyways.

[6/5/2025] SUPPORT (Forrest):
<https://docs.seam.co/latest/api/user_identities/generate_instant_key>

[6/9/2025] SUPPORT (Sy Bohy):
<@U0FDXBEDA|peter> i need to double check but our java sdk should be working to support this.

[6/9/2025] SUPPORT (Sy Bohy):
ok i just inquired internally. please ping me in a couple of days if i haven't responded/followed-up on this

[6/9/2025] SUPPORT (Phil):
<@U0FDXBEDA|peter> we also have a openapi spec here that has all of the rest endpoints <https://connect.getseam.com/openapi.json>

[6/10/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
<@U012TSFGM5M|Sy Bohy> The last update to the Java SDK was about 11 months ago, so it's probably quite outdated by now :wink:
Also, the error handling is a bit sketchy — there's only a single generic `ApiError` exception class. To get any meaningful error handling, we have to manually parse the status code and error type string ourselves.

In addition, we’re occasionally seeing some random (though luckily infrequent) errors where the request doesn’t seem to close properly when a retry is triggered.
```Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: cannot make a new request because the previous response is still open: please call response.close()
	at okhttp3.internal.connection.RealCall.enterNetworkInterceptorExchange(RealCall.kt:229)
	at okhttp3.internal.http.RetryAndFollowUpInterceptor.intercept(RetryAndFollowUpInterceptor.kt:66)
	at okhttp3.internal.http.RealInterceptorChain.proceed(RealInterceptorChain.kt:109)

	at com.seam.api.resources.accesscodes.AccessCodesClient.create(AccessCodesClient.java:53)```

Therefore I don't really mind using the REST API directly - this gives us a little more control over the integration.

[6/24/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
Hey team :wave: just a few things we noticed - not sure if they’re intentional or still evolving:
1. *Spaces* don’t seem to be tied to connected accounts and appear to be global. There’s also no way to store additional metadata on a space - meaning we can't associate a space to a certain customer/hotel.
2. The `/spaces/get` and `/spaces/list` endpoints don’t return associated `device_ids` or `acs_entrance_ids`, which makes it hard to understand what a space represents.
3. Ideally, space creation/modification would be exposed via a *UI component*, since this is something every integration partner would otherwise have to build individually.
Since spaces aren’t fully usable for our case yet, we’ll go ahead with passing `acs_entrance_ids` and `device_ids` directly when calling `/access_grants/create`.
Apart from that, no roadblocks so far - everything’s been working smoothly. Thanks!

[6/24/2025] SUPPORT (Ravi Chodavarapu):
Hi <@U0FDXBEDA|peter> thank you for the feedback! I just wanted to leave a few notes:
• Spaces are indeed global within a workspace. We are working on ways to associate spaces with an individual customer, and potentially add metadata, but this is not immediately available.
• For now, the `/devices/list` and the `/acs/entrances/list` endpoints do allow you to list the devices and entrances that are part of a space by specifying a `space_id` parameter. We are working on returning the associated device IDs and entrance IDs in additional ways as well.
• We are indeed working on a UI component that you can use as a drop-in component. This is a white-labeled component hosted by Seam (but can be on your custom domain) that can be redirected to or embedded in an iframe that allows your customers to create and manage spaces. This is part of the Customer Portals product that was announced in the last changelog.

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
Hello, we have now implemented a very basic version of the instant keys into our hotel management software and we have encountered three issues

1. The following requests returns an internal server error (when it should in fact return a validation error, because no spaces, entrances or devices have been passed)
<https://connect.getseam.com/access_grants/create>
```{
    "user_identity": {
        "full_name": "Test1",
        "email_address": "test@hotelmeister.com"
    },
    "requested_access_methods": [
        {
            "mode": "mobile_key"
        }
    ],
    "starts_at": "2025-06-20T15:30:00Z",
    "ends_at": "2025-06-27T07:30:00Z"
}```

```{
    "error": {
        "type": "internal_server_error",
        "message": "syntax error at or near \")\"",
        "request_id": "8dc88e6f-f114-4354-a832-c45c4af48083"
    },
    "ok": false
}```

2. The datetime for the starts_at and ends_at have to be in UTC, otherwise they will get rejected with validation errors:

For POST <https://connect.getseam.com/access_codes/create> the following works perfectly fine
```{"starts_at":"2025-06-20T17:30:00.000+02:00","code":"7957","device_id":"d079e155-fe5e-48c8-8c4b-5d76edec4727","name":"HSC_RES_5386_1750285920124","attempt_for_offline_device":false,"ends_at":"2025-06-27T09:30:00.000+02:00"}```

But for POST <https://connect.getseam.com/access_grants/create> the following returns a validation error
```{"starts_at":"2025-06-20T17:30:00.000+02:00","requested_access_methods":[{"mode":"mobile_key"}],"ends_at":"2025-06-27T09:30:00.000+02:00"}```

Response (we intentionally left out the user_identity as adding the user_identity causes the above mentioned error)
```{"error":{"type":"invalid_input","message":"3 Input Errors: Invalid input, Invalid datetime for \"starts_at\", Invalid datetime for \"ends_at\"","validation_errors":{"_errors":[],"user_identity_id":{"_errors":["Required"]},"user_identity":{"_errors":["Required"]},"starts_at":{"_errors":["Invalid datetime"]},"ends_at":{"_errors":["Invalid datetime"]}},"request_id":"48775d6d-c039-4c12-b599-4239c50cf526"},"ok":false}```

3. Your NPM library seems to contain an accessGrants update method
```await seam.accessGrants.update({
  access_grant_id: "grant-1",
  starts_at: "2025-04-10T12:00:00Z", // updated start
  ends_at: "2025-04-15T14:00:00Z"    // updated end
})```

but your OpenAPI spec doesn't seem to contain an /access_grant/update endpoint (see screenshot attached)

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
<@U03N1V3903C|Ravi Chodavarapu> in addition to the above mentioned items we also didn't get a `space_id` in `entrances/list` or `devices/list`, but as we are using devices and entrances this is something we can look into at a later stage

[6/25/2025] SUPPORT (Ravi Chodavarapu):
<@U0FDXBEDA|peter> thanks for these:
1. Totally right, we should be returning a validation error instead, will fix.
2. We'll take a look at this, we should accept non-UTC times

The other issues: are you using the openapi from <https://connect.getseam.com/openapi.json> , or somewhere else?

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):

[6/25/2025] SUPPORT (Ravi Chodavarapu):
&gt; I just checked again and now it seems to be in there
ah, ok, yes, there have been indeed recent changes:  `access_grants/update` is newly released to allow times to be updated. The `spaces` terminology is what we settled on - it was previously called `locations` during initial development - so previously you'll probably have had `location_id` in the `/acs/entrances/list` and `/devices/list`.

try that one!

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
Just two more things as the `access_grant/create` service also supports `card` and `code`

1. for `card` it's pretty clear that we have to call `/acs/encoders/encode_access_method` - just wondering if we could call this method twice, if the guest needs two cards?
2. for `code` I haven't found an end to end sample yet - as far as I can see the code is always generated by the ACS, right? But how do I get this code ? `access_grant/create` returns
```    "requested_access_methods": [
      {
        "display_name": "PIN Code Credential",
        "mode": "code",
        "created_at": "2025-06-16T16:54:17.946606Z",
        "created_access_method_ids": ["a1b2c3d4-e5f6-4a3b-2c1d-0e9f8a7b6c5d"]
      },
...```

For the instant key I can call `access_methods/get` to get the `instant_key_url` but how can I get the code?

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
One more thing I noticed: I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the Seam app. After installation, Android asked whether to open the link in the browser or in the app. I picked “browser,” and it didn’t ask again - I ended up on the website with no obvious way back to the app or app store.

I think real users might run into the same issue, so it would be great if the keys web page included a link to the app store as a fallback.

Thanks for the feedback, we're aware of this and it's on our todo list for making the android experience better. Thank you for testing this out, this is super helpful!

1. for `card` it's pretty clear that we have to call `/acs/encoders/encode_access_method` - just wondering if we could call this method twice, if the guest needs two cards?
each individual access method requested can only be encoded once, but you can request 2 access methods with `mode: "card"`

1. for `code` I haven't found an end to end sample yet - as far as I can see the code is always generated by the ACS, right? But how do I get this code ? `access_grant/create` returns
Through access grants, we only support creating code grants for some smart lock systems at the moment. But we'll be expanding this quickly. Which systems are you looking to create codes with?

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
<@U03N1V3903C|Ravi Chodavarapu> first we would mainly be look at those which also use mobile keys (Salto KS, Salto Space, Visionline, Vostio) - as this would give us the ability to have one unified API no matter if the guest uses Code, Mobile Key or Card. Especially for the online check-in we could send the guest a mobile key and a code - if someone doesn't want to install the app or can't (because his company policy prevents him from doing so, or because he doesn't have a smartphone) he could still use the code as a backup solution.

[6/25/2025] SUPPORT (Ravi Chodavarapu):
<@U0FDXBEDA|peter> :+1: makes sense. The intention is to provide a unified API no matter the access method. We do support mobile keys across those systems using access grants now. We support plastic card creation and encoding using access grants on Salto Space, Visionline and Vostio. We currently do not support PIN codes on those systems, and I can check how much of that is due to underlying system support, and if we can prioritize.

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
<@U03N1V3903C|Ravi Chodavarapu> would be great if you could check whether the lack of PIN support is due to system limitations and let me know.

I think we can start with mobile keys for some early customers, but for a broader rollout, PIN support would be very helpful.

PIN code locks have the lowest tech barrier for guests and are a valuable fallback - especially for smaller hotels or late-night arrivals where no staff is available to assist with card encoding if the mobile key doesn't work.

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
By the way - I just came across <https://mobileaccess.seam.co/> and noticed that the Google Play Store link points to a non-existent app.

[6/25/2025] SUPPORT (dawn):
<@U0FDXBEDA|peter> which locks or access systems are you looking to roll out access codes on? Is this for Salto?

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
<@U012TSERYA3|dawn> yes, Salto would most likely be the first. We already have customers using Salto code locks — so supporting both code + mobile key would open up upsell opportunities.

In Europe, we still see lots of older Android phones in use (32% of all Android devices used in Europe are still running on Android 12 or older), plus some guests (especially elderly or less tech-savvy ones) are hesitant to install apps. Android holds ~64% market share here, and some users are even restricted from installing apps due to company policies.

I think Instant Keys are a great product, but they are not at a point yet, where we could solely rely on Instant Keys. Customers will definitely ask for fallback options. For Salto KS, at least, we could use remote unlock so the guest can access the hotel main entrance and their room - and pick up a key card at the front desk the next day.

[6/25/2025] SUPPORT (dawn):
Makes sense. Would adding remote unlock / access codes / fobs help cover all the bases for Salto KS?

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
If we’re dreaming a bit — it’d be great if the web version of the key included remote unlock buttons per door, assuming the access system supports it.

Otherwise, we’ll likely build an intermediary layer on our side that either links to the instant key or offers remote unlock options when the instant key can’t be used for whatever reason.
We’d probably hide the remote unlock behind a small link like “Mobile key not working?” — clicking it would reveal the available remote unlock buttons for each door the user is authorized to open and that supports the feature.

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
Obviously, only works with `locks` and not with `entrances`

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
<@U03N1V3903C|Ravi Chodavarapu>

the following request fails with an `internal_server_error`

```{

  ],
  "ends_at": "2025-06-27T07:30:00Z"

It seems like the empty `acs_entrance_ids` is causing this issue, but as far as I understood it, it should work with just `device_ids` ?

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
<@U0775E12MJM|Phil> If there’s anything you’d like me to test, feel free to send over the updated APK. I can sideload it on my device, so we don't have to wait for play store approval.

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Ravi Chodavarapu):
&gt; It seems like the empty `acs_entrance_ids` is causing this issue, but as far as I understood it, it should work with just `device_ids` ?
Hi <@U0FDXBEDA|peter>, yes, just `device_ids` should work. This is a slightly different issue: basically, its that we currently only support `code` access methods for `device`s, which are used for consumer smart locks and smart devices. We are working on adding validation and tools around checking the access methods that are supported for entrances and devices. This should be available today, I can let you know once its ready. For ex., you will see that `/acs/entrances/list` returns `can_unlock_with_mobile_key`, `can_unlock_with_card`, etc. You will get a validation error if you request a combination of access methods on entrances or devices that are not supported.

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Evan):
<@U0FDXBEDA|peter> Just a heads up, as part of our ongoing iteration on this early access API, we are planning to deploy these two breaking changes. Let me know if that would be ok, or if you need a stable migration path :slightly_smiling_face:

• Moved `/acs/encodes/encode_access_method` to `/access_methods/encode`
• Renamed `access_method.is_card_encoding_required` to `access_method.is_encoding_required`

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
<@U048JGPNGNS|Evan> works for me, just let me know when it's deployed and we'll change it accordingly

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Ravi Chodavarapu):
Just a quick update: we added flags on devices you get back from `/devices/list` and entrances you get back from `/acs/entrances/list` (and also get endpoints) flags to indicate whether these entrances support the various access method modes: you should find the following flags set to `true` if they support these modes - `can_unlock_with_code`, `can_unlock_with_mobile_key` , and `can_unlock_with_card`

[6/27/2025] SUPPORT (Evan):
<@U0FDXBEDA|peter> The encoder API changes are out.

Side note, not sure if we mentioned this, but the API reference docs for these APIs are live and updated at least once a day with the latest changes :slightly_smiling_face:  For example: <https://docs.seam.co/latest/api>

The APIs are also fully available in our SDKs if you choose to use them (I do strongly recommend to if possible :slightly_smiling_face: )

[7/3/2025] SUPPORT (Phil):
<@U0FDXBEDA|peter> -- also we've made some updates to the Android app so it should be back on track now

[7/3/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):

TITLE: Assistance with enabling Latch access for ZRS buildings
CUSTOMER: EliseAI
WORKSPACE ID: Not specified
ASSIGNED TO: Jack Finley
TAGS: res: waiting for response
CREATED: 6/24/2025
CLOSED: 7/14/2025

SUMMARY: The customer sought assistance enabling Latch access for ZRS buildings via Seam, but the support team explained that Latch is not onboarding new customers through Seam due to development updates. The support team escalated the issue to Latch's CRO and discussed potential impacts on customers. Latch ultimately declined the integration, prompting ZRS to explore manual workarounds for creating and managing pin codes.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/24/2025] CUSTOMER (Molly Hatch):
Hi Seam Team - <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> <@U067F5HD4BX|Forrest> is there someone who can please assist us with helping enable Latch access for the requested ZRS buildings?

We've followed up with ZRS and Latch.  It's also my understanding Jonny (who is OOO) originally requested credentials for the ZRS buildings (Zang Flats, Capitol Flats, Willow, and Kessler Bluffs) from Seam. But we haven't received so following up.

[6/24/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U08LTJT5FT8|Molly Hatch> - unfortunately, Latch's team told us this morning that they are not enabling any new customers through Seam while they finish new development updates to their OpenKit product. So, for now, we are blocked on enabling access for those buildings.

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (Molly Hatch):
I see. Thanks, <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley>. Could you please share the point of contact your team works with at Latch?

We have many customers interested in the Latch integration via Seam and I'd love to speak with them directly to ensure they're aware of the opportunity.

[6/25/2025] SUPPORT (Sy Bohy):
hey <@U08LTJT5FT8|Molly Hatch> — sy here. I'm pretty baffled by their decision. Let me try to ping them to see if we can move this forward. my hunch is Gabby is the best person; Ryan could be good as well. I'll follow up to schedule a call  with them

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (Molly Hatch):
Thanks, Sy! Yes, happy to jump on a call with them. Again, I just want to ensure they understand the opportunity... and we haven't been able to speak to them directly apart from Sales rep and their general integrations inbox

[6/25/2025] SUPPORT (Sy Bohy):
yeah... at some point, i'll fill you in on our experience with Latch. it's been interesting

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (Molly Hatch):
tracks... but appreciate you looking into setting up a call and please keep me posted

[6/25/2025] SUPPORT (Sy Bohy):
<@U08LTJT5FT8|Molly Hatch> would it be possible to know the name of the customers impacted by the lack of access to Latch? Do you also have a sense if those customers would expand their relationship with latch (ie buy more hardware) over time?

<@U04MFQT2BV4|Sharon Lee> on our team is going to escalate to their CRO but we need some help identifying to him the customers that are likely to be upset if Latch refuses to onboard you guys. 

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (Molly Hatch):
Thanks Sy and Sharon!

Confirming internally & will get back to you tomorrow.

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Molly Hatch):
Hi <@U012TSFGM5M|Sy Bohy> <@U04MFQT2BV4|Sharon Lee> - you can include ZRS and Brookfield to start. We also have a top 5 Property Management Company considering purchasing Latch locks for Elise's AI Guided Tour product... assuming Latch enables the integration.

EliseAI is in ~4M Units.  We'd love to be able to suggest Latch, via Seam.  As we're speaking to more and more customers and they're asking EliseAI which locks to buy.

Can you include me in the communication to Latch?  If there's a call scheduled then happy to share more details with them over call.  Thanks again!

[6/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Molly Hatch):
Hi both - any word?

[6/27/2025] SUPPORT (Sharon Lee):
Hi Molly!  Sorry for the delay -- I've been on PTO.  Will get the email intro to you and the Latch CRO out today.

[6/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Molly Hatch):
Hi Sharon - no problem! Really appreciate your help here especially while you're out!

[6/30/2025] SUPPORT (Sharon Lee):
Hi <@U08LTJT5FT8|Molly Hatch> - I saw your email to Latch about whether Door/Latch is already integrated with Seam.  They are already integrated and we have the integration live and working at an Avalon Bay building.  I figured I would ping you here to confirm since I think your question to Ryan is mainly to have him think harder about his position of not allowing Seam to onboard more customers / buildings.

[6/30/2025] CUSTOMER (Molly Hatch):
Yes, I want to make sure he understands their integration with yall is already live. Which ofc he should know but the way his email read made me wonder... Since enabling for ZRS via your existing integration is very different from onboarding a new integration partner (as he wrote).

Apologies for any confusion, but appreciate you reaching out to confirm.

[6/30/2025] CUSTOMER (Molly Hatch):
and hopefully we hear back soon!

[6/30/2025] SUPPORT (Sharon Lee):
Agreed that onboarding a new integration partner is different than just allowing Seam to have access to an existing hardware customer's workspace.  I think our best bet is to continue showing them that they're giving up current or future revenue by not allowing your integration for ZRS, which either upsets an existing customer or means they will not be chosen for new hardware opportunities.  If ZRS has a contact at Latch, it probably wouldn't hurt for them to reach out either.

[6/30/2025] CUSTOMER (Molly Hatch):
Yes, that's why I asked him to confirm he means not enabling ZRS via the seam integration v onboarding a new integration partner. As I called out, we need to tell ZRS either way tomorrow.  So if he confirms it's a no then I'll let ZRS know and they can follow up with Latch

[7/1/2025] SUPPORT (Sharon Lee):
Hi Molly, not urgent but just checking in on how ZRS handled the news. Thanks!

[7/2/2025] CUSTOMER (Molly Hatch):
Hi Sharon - Latch told ZRS "we are unfortunately unable to facilitate this integration with Seam at the moment"

ZRS responded asking for manual workarounds where they create pin codes in Latch then add into Elise manually... That's being explored.

I haven't heard back from Latch directly on our email thread.. but I'll keep you posted if there's any good traction through any channel.

[7/3/2025] SUPPORT (Sy Bohy):
The heck kind of work around is this… 

[7/3/2025] SUPPORT (Sy Bohy):
What a joke

[7/7/2025] CUSTOMER (Molly Hatch):
Not an ideal one!

ASSIGNED TO: Jack Finley
TAGS: res: seam-side bug resolved, tri: needs bug fix
CREATED: 5/23/2025
CLOSED: 7/7/2025

SUMMARY: The customer reported an issue with Kwikset locks where modifying access code times created duplicate codes instead of updating existing ones. The support team investigated, identified potential causes, and released a fix on 2025-06-26, which may have resolved the issue, though further testing is ongoing.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[5/23/2025] CUSTOMER (Jose Colon):
Hi team,
We're running into this error for Kwikset locks. Error is `Unable to confirm that the access code is set on the Kwikset device. This is likely due to a duplicate pin code on the device that was set outside of Seam.`

It seems when an alteration is made and an attempt to modify the existing codes start/end times, it instead is creating a new code causing the duplicate error above.
Example for two locks attached to one property, these codes are for 1 reservation:
```Device 1:
0ea566e8-d8d5-4b7d-aa8f-1f7d6bff5b92,

Codes:
b7e635c3-eff8-444a-9675-f12cde756974
b5deb3bb-47e6-42a0-93d5-e924fa678816

Device 2: 
- dfe95182-1320-4ec0-b63f-9a40718baf0c

Codes: 
- 265afddd-adb5-48fd-a8fb-3f24651673ad
 0364af62-1e39-4ab4-85de-485465e7e92c```

[5/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Jose Colon):
Hi <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley>, sorry for the follow up. Seems this is affecting all locks for this account.

[5/27/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U05QQPNMC92|Jose Colon>, sorry for the slow reply over the holiday weekend! I'll take a look here

[5/27/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U05QQPNMC92|Jose Colon> Checking that device, I see a `CREATE_ACCESS_CODE` command was issued for `b5deb3bb-47e6-42a0-93d5-e924fa678816` :

```{
  "code": "1042",
  "name": "39929174 Anne Deeter",
  "type": "CREATE_ACCESS_CODE",
  "ends_at": "2025-05-20T15:00:00.000Z",
  "device_id": "0ea566e8-d8d5-4b7d-aa8f-1f7d6bff5b92",

  "max_time_rounding": "1hour",
  "attempt_for_offline_device": true
}```

Just confirming, you are saying that Hostaway did not send that command and Seam is incorrectly creating that by itself?

[5/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Jose Colon):
I see they changed their check in date from 05-17 to 05-16 on 05-12 but this shouldn't trigger an event to create a 2nd/new code, no? It should only adjust the existing code b7e635c3-eff8-444a-9675-f12cde756974 to my understanding but I can confirm with engineering on our end if needed.

[5/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Mikhail Klyuev):
<@U05QQPNMC92|Jose Colon> Yes, it should modify the existing code, not create a new one. A new access code is created only if the offline code needs to be changed.

[5/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Mikhail Klyuev):
From our side, that devices are shown as online

[5/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Jose Colon):
Thank you for confirming <@U041HDW3AG7|Mikhail Klyuev>. So to answer Jack's question, we didn't send a create access code event to Seam? It triggered on their side?

[5/28/2025] CUSTOMER (Mikhail Klyuev):
In that case I see we had request to

1. Create access code at `2025-05-09 19:00:22`
  2. two updates requests on `2025-05-12 17:24:13` (attempt_id `187a8276-eb80-49c5-850f-8bdc8f9faa9f`) and then `2025-05-16 04:06:14` (attempt_id `3d385784-c9c3-400e-a177-3738947d3348`)
  3. At `2025-05-16 21:37:57` we received `access_codes was removed` from device webhook.
  4. After that send create access code again at `2025-05-16 21:38:14`
  5. At `2025-05-16 22:22:56` we recieved `access_code.delay_in_setting_on_device webhook `
  6. And at `2025-05-16 23:21:07` `access_code.failed_to_set_on_device`

Looks like client delete code externally, then we had to create new one. But then we received delay and failed to set webhook. And not clear why. If it duplicate error, why we got `access_codes was removed `webhook. Is it really was deleted.

<@U05QQPNMC92|Jose Colon> I found it <https://hostawaymaster.hostaway.com/smartlock-logs|here>

[5/28/2025] CUSTOMER (Mikhail Klyuev):
And could we confirm requests to update access codes from second point was successful, that time we had a few of complains about not updated codes on device level with Kwikset from several customers

[6/9/2025] CUSTOMER (Vladimir Pismennyy):
Any updates on that issue?

[6/10/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hi team, no update yet, really appreciate the patience here! We are working on a myriad of Kwikset fixes for the issues identified here (and other threads), am hopeful we can push these out in the coming days.

[6/19/2025] CUSTOMER (Yanni):
Hey <@U06AY2HQXFC|Frank> <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> these issues seem to have been going on for a long time now. Are there any updates on this and is there a roadmap on the kwikset fixes that you can share with us please, so that it can help make the lives of our colleagues in the support teams easier? Thanks a lot in advance

[6/20/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U04M68GP24E|Yanni> I really appreciate the team's patience here, I know a lot of these kwikset issues have been hanging for a while and am sure it's not fun at all for the support team.

I'll sync up with Frank and the team on Monday to give you a timeline of when we can push out fixes for these issues.

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (Yanni):
ok Jack. Let's discuss it today during our catch up. Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:

[7/1/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Hello. I wanted to check in on this and ask if you have seen any other instances of this error?

We released a fix that is essentially adjacent to this but I think it may also have fixed this problem.

I haven't been able to recreate this issue since the change went live but I'm going to continue testing to see if I can recreate this problem with our own lab device

[7/1/2025] CUSTOMER (Jose Colon):
<@U0665SWKXPH|Chris> Could you share the day the fix went live?

[7/2/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Of course! We merged a fix in around 2025-06-26 13:00 (UTC) and it would have been deployed around 15 minutes later looking at the logs

TITLE: Inquiry about Schlage RCA
CUSTOMER: MyQ
WORKSPACE ID: Not specified
ASSIGNED TO: Frank
TAGS: res: no resolution needed
CREATED: 6/2/2025
CLOSED: 7/14/2025

SUMMARY: Schlage experienced an outage affecting account connections, access code sync, and unlock functionality, which was resolved around 5:30 PM PT. Monitoring continued due to inconsistencies in their status page, and a follow-up on the root cause analysis (RCA) is pending as the Schlage team is at an offsite.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[5/30/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hello Team - Schlage is in a confirmed outage right now. Their team is actively working on a fix. We detected elevated errors around 9am US-PST with minimal impact to devices and started receiving reports of customer issues around ~1:00pm US-PST. You may see increased reports of:
• failures in new customer accounts attempting to connect in connect webviews
• access code sync failures
• unlock functionality (PIN code and remote unlock) failure
• account disconnects due to token refresh failures

This is unfortunately not reflected on Allegion's live status page <https://status.allegion.com/|here>, but we will share our latest updates as they happen. Accounts will automatically reconnect once this is resolved. Please let us know if you experience any additional issues with Schlage accounts - it is more than likely it is related to this.

cc: <@U04U257P1JT|Johnny Jung>

[5/30/2025] SUPPORT (Frank):
Hi team, we've been monitoring for the past few hours and it appears that Schlage's outage has been resolved. :white_check_mark:

It appeared that Schlage had resolved their issue at around 530pm PT today, and we've continued to monitor the devices for the last few hours, given that their status page has been inconsistent with what we've been experiencing. Devices should be syncing again as expected. Please let us know if you continue to experience any issues.

[6/2/2025] CUSTOMER (tfp):
<@U06AY2HQXFC|Frank> Did Schlage issue you an RCA?

[6/6/2025] SUPPORT (Frank):
Oops, following up here, the Schlage team is conveniently at an offsite this week, will be following up on Monday.

SUMMARY: The support rep introduced two new products, Customer Portal and Automations, to the customer and proposed a demo. After discussing scheduling constraints, they agreed on a demo time of 3:30pm CEST, and the customer accepted the calendar invite.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[7/9/2025] SUPPORT (Forrest):
Hey <@U0FDXBEDA|peter>! Thank you for all of your feedback on the Instant Key product. The team is super grateful for your help.

We have another new product you might be interested in. It's called Customer Portal and allows you to leverage Seam for the all of the UI for your hotel managers to see/manage their devices at the property. It's still white-labeled and embedded inside your product as an iframe. There's a how-to guide <https://seamco.notion.site/How-To-Use-Customer-Portal-21e6d6d0a10d8053af21d739a73d51c6|here>.

There's also a product called Automations where you can push your reservation data to Seam and we will push back webhooks containing an Instant Key, Apple Wallet, plastic card encoding, access code, etc. This is not publicly available but we'd be happy to demo it for you on a Zoom call.

Would you be interested in hopping on with one of our engineers (<@U03N1V3903C|Ravi Chodavarapu>) tomorrow or Friday for a quick demo and to get your thoughts?

[7/9/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
Hey <@U067F5HD4BX|Forrest>, great to hear about these new product developments - both features sound very promising. I'd be happy to hop on a quick demo. Tomorrow could work for me - could you let me know which timezone <@U03N1V3903C|Ravi Chodavarapu> is in so we can find a good time?

[7/9/2025] SUPPORT (Forrest):
Great! Ravi is in Ireland right now with family, so he's only one hour behind you. I'll join as well and am in California. How about 4pm or 5pm CET?

[7/9/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
Thanks for the quick reply! I need to head out shortly after 4pm CEST tomorrow, so unfortunately 4pm or 5pm won’t work on my end.
I could do something earlier in the day (though I realize that might be very early for you in California) or alternatively much later, around 10pm CEST - though I imagine that might not be ideal for Rave since he is travelling with his family. Let me know what works best. I don't think we need very long - maybe 3.45pm - I think we should be done in 15-30 minutes.

[7/9/2025] SUPPORT (Forrest):
Okay, no worries! How about 330pm CEST?

[7/9/2025] CUSTOMER (peter):
yes, that would work me

[7/9/2025] SUPPORT (Forrest):
Perfect, invite sent! Talk soon

CREATED: 5/31/2025

SUMMARY: The customer reported "access_code.failed_to_set_on_device" errors for two devices. The support team identified the issue as an expired Kwikset account token and suggested re-authentication, but the problem persisted. A fix was escalated and expected by the end of the week, but later updates indicated the errors had stopped two weeks ago, with the customer awaiting further details from the host about recent issues.

[6/2/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U05QQPNMC92|Jose Colon>, I checked the logs we're getting back for both devices for further insight into what's going on - it appears to be that their Kwikset account token has expired which is causing the errors. Is it possible to ask the customer to go through the connection flow and re-authenticate?

[6/3/2025] CUSTOMER (Jose Colon):
Hey <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> thanks for looking into all these cases. All set with the re-authentication, could you confirm if the token is valid again?

[6/9/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U05QQPNMC92|Jose Colon> Sorry for the delay here, didn't forget about this one! Thanks for having the customer do that step, that usually resolves the error in instances like these. I surfaced this along with a few other Kwikset bugs to the team, so am hopeful we can have a fix here by EoW

I've been looking at the issue here but the jobs seem to be no longer failing as of two weeks ago. Can you confirm that with the customer? Not really much I can do here since it all looks fine from our perspective. :thinking_face: The access codes seem to be healthy but reach out to me if somethings's still amiss

[7/1/2025] CUSTOMER (Jose Colon):

WORKSPACE ID: Not specified
ASSIGNED TO: Lucas
TAGS: res: waiting for response
CREATED: 6/10/2025
CLOSED: 7/7/2025

SUMMARY: The conversation focused on clarifying the functionality of online and offline codes for access systems, particularly Latch, and their limitations. Support reps explained that online codes require syncing via the Latch Manager app, while offline codes are always available for offline doors, and provided documentation links and capability flags for further understanding. Mobile keys were also discussed, with clarification that they are automatically provisioned for Latch users via the Seam Mobile SDK, and are not currently supported for smart locks. The customer sought additional details on extending support to other locks beyond Latch.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/10/2025] CUSTOMER (Prashant Odhavani):
<@U012TSERYA3|Dawn> <@U05KH0LDLJH|Max Stoumen> <@U05RK8C96PQ|Lucas>: Could you provide details on the following points?
• The field `IsMultiPhoneSyncCredential` that we include in the request body when creating an ACS credential (`acs/credentials/create` API). How does this field function when set to true or false?
• What is the difference between online/offline PIN codes, and how will it work?
    • Online - `acs/credentials/create` (based on observation, we can have only one active PIN code)
    • Offline - `acs/credentials/create_offline_code` (based on observation, we can have multiple PIN codes for the same ACS user and entrance - but time frame limited to Today or Tomorrow)
    • And, how do we know which type of credential the ACS system supports?

[6/10/2025] SUPPORT (Lucas):
Hey <@U02QM4SE72L|Prashant Odhavani>,
• Let me know if this clarify your questions: <https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/mobile-access/issuing-mobile-credentials-from-an-access-control-system>
• You're right, for latch you can have multiple offline codes but 1 online, and your time observations also are correct, those all are latch specific requirements/constrains.
• We're working on providing `capability_flags` to give you that info through the API. right now I can clarify any of your questions if you want to know something specifically. For offline codes only latch support them atm.

[6/16/2025] CUSTOMER (Parth Baraiya):
Hi <@U05RK8C96PQ|Lucas> <@U012TSERYA3|dawn>, can you please clarify how users can use online and offline codes?

So, if I have a device in which I have an online and offline code and I want to test if both codes are working or not. How can I do it?

Also how mobile keys will work? Do we need to generate mobile keys manually or it will be generate automatically for a device? What is the purpose of mobile key?

[6/16/2025] SUPPORT (dawn):
For a building, you'll want to double check if all of the door locks are online.

If they are not, offline codes will be available all the time.
Online codes need to get synced to the door lock by an operator using the Latch Manager mobile app.

[6/16/2025] SUPPORT (dawn):
Mobile keys will work for online and offline doors

[6/16/2025] SUPPORT (Evan):
<@U01H7DV69PV|Parth Baraiya> For `mobile_key` credentials, you will not need to create them via the Seam API when using users created and managed on the Latch Dashboard. They will be provision on the phone via the Seam Mobile SDK via the Latch SDK. This is why they are not mentioned in your integration guide: <https://seamco.notion.site/Flamingo-Latch-OTP-Verification-Guide-1ac6d6d0a10d8082b108fe4f7a9cd509?pvs=74>

We are aware this asymmetry with Latch and `mobile_key` is a point of confusion and are working on improving the API here, but for now you don't have to worry about mobile keys for those users :slightly_smiling_face:

[6/16/2025] CUSTOMER (Parth Baraiya):
<@U048JGPNGNS|Evan> <@U012TSERYA3|dawn> FYI, we are talking about all types of locks / access systems here. Not just latch.

[6/16/2025] SUPPORT (dawn):
ahh

[6/16/2025] SUPPORT (dawn):
i'll bring in <@U06AY2HQXFC|Frank>  to talk more about this.
Mobile keys are not currently supported in smart locks

[6/16/2025] SUPPORT (dawn):
<@U06AY2HQXFC|Frank>, Parth wanted to learn more about how online and offline codes work in the Smart Lock space

[6/16/2025] CUSTOMER (Parth Baraiya):
We were focused on latch earlier but now that we are almost done for the latch, we are adding support for all the available locks on seam.

[6/16/2025] SUPPORT (Evan):
Ah missed that! Awesome :slightly_smiling_face:

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (Prashant Odhavani):
<@U05RK8C96PQ|Lucas>, are the `capability_flags` available for us to know which type of credential entrance or access system supports online/offline access?

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (Prashant Odhavani):
<@U05RK8C96PQ|Lucas> does the entrance or access system only support a single type of credential, or can it handle multiple types, such as both online and offline credentials?

<https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/device-and-system-capabilities>

[6/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Prashant Odhavani):
<@U012TSERYA3|dawn> it seems this applies to devices like August, Yale, and Schlage...
 but what about ACS systems like Latch?

[6/30/2025] CUSTOMER (Prashant Odhavani):
<@U012TSERYA3|Dawn Ho> <@U05RK8C96PQ|Lucas> Reminder^

[6/30/2025] SUPPORT (Lucas):
For the acs systems api we only allow it on Latch

[6/30/2025] SUPPORT (Lucas):
AFAIK all latch entrances can create offline codes

CLOSED: 7/7/2025

SUMMARY: The customer reported issues with Lockly locks, including incorrect code lengths, missing start/end dates, and codes not being set correctly. The support team identified and fixed multiple bugs, including code length support and external modification detection, while addressing API limitations and communication delays. After extensive testing and collaboration with the customer, the issue appeared resolved, but the customer was advised to monitor the locks for any further problems.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[2/20/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
I have another issue with the Lockly locks.  It's returning
```supported_code_lengths: [
                6
            ]```
but the customer says Lockly should support 6 to 8 code lengths.  Can you take a look?

<https://console.seam.co/workspaces/70966c94-c23d-488e-a5e8-eae95d4d6ce5/devices/45723e4f-8494-4a42-a56a-8ac8e95052a0>

[2/20/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
The customer is saying that some of the codes that is being sent don't have a start and end date.  See screenshot, the top code was set by Seam (I think) and doesn't have a start and end date

[2/21/2025] SUPPORT (Frank):
Hey <@U01A6BVD03E|Tom Krones>, it looks like there's a bug with how we're supporting Lockly code lengths. I've flagged this to the team to fix this next week.

As for the access code, can you verify which access code (and access code id) is having issues?

[2/22/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
Awesome, thanks.

It's the `Wendy Jershky` reservation the code should be `165303` (the top one).  Currently, Host Tools is sending the 6-digit codes, and the user is manually adding the 7-digit codes.

I can't get the access code because for some reason the site crashes when I try to view the lock here: <https://console.seam.co/workspaces/70966c94-c23d-488e-a5e8-eae95d4d6ce5/devices/45723e4f-8494-4a42-a56a-8ac8e95052a0>

[2/22/2025] SUPPORT (Frank):
Ah I see, so the user is manually changing the code? I'll see if I can reproduce that behavior internally. I suspect it may not be playing nice in combination with the bug I mentioned before!

[2/28/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
Hi Frank.  I wanted to touch base about this issue.  Has the dev team been able to figure out the issue?

[3/3/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
<@U06AY2HQXFC|Frank> any updates?

[3/3/2025] SUPPORT (Frank):
Hey <@U01A6BVD03E|Tom Krones>, apologies for the delay. The team is still working on a fix re: the code length, and we'll be sure to reach out when it is resolved. There was an issue identified, but we're also seeing some issues around device metadata updating as expected. We've also reached out to the team at Lockly to see if they can help with some of the development rate limit hiccups we've been seeing.

[3/4/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
Thanks for the update.  What type of metadata isn't updating on Lockly?  Does that include the start/end dates? Hopefully, the Lockly team is responsive, and we can get this fixed soon.

[3/6/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
<@U06AY2HQXFC|Frank> any updates?

[3/6/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U01A6BVD03E|Tom Krones>, I can't speak to the metadata not updating that Frank alluded to, but the main issue of Lockly devices not supporting 6-8 digits has been fixed. Your user's codes should now be able to set 6, 7 or 8 digit codes. Please let us know if you are still seeing any issues!

[3/13/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
We are still seeing issues.  The code we are sending to Seam is not the same code being set on the lock.  I think there might also be an issue with the times we are sending.  I'll confirm again with the customer and get back to you.

[3/14/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley>, I'm following up on my last message:

The current issue with this account is that the locks are not getting set with the correct codes and they also don't have a start/end date.

[3/17/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> This customer is starting to get upset and is saying they are threatening to cancel :neutral_face:.  Any updates on this?

[3/17/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U01A6BVD03E|Tom Krones>, apologies for the delay here. Can you please share what the expected code and starts/ends at date were for the "Anthony Murphee" user? From our end, I see the `CREATE_ACCESS_CODE` action was called and successfully run, so am just going based off that:

Once I have that I can follow-up with the team on what is going on.

[3/18/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
Hi <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> thanks for writing back.

Do you mind if we test with the code for `Lyle Swanson `since the other reservation has passed?  The code for Lyle is currently `set` and every time I check it, it's using a value different than what I'm sending.  For example:

I will send this data (`code: '3088688'`):
```await seam.accessCodes.update({
    access_code_id: '6842a273-b833-4855-9794-ca00209e999b',
    code: '3088688',
    name: 'Lyle Swanson',
    starts_at: '2025-03-13T11:00:00-07:00',
    ends_at: '2025-03-19T08:30:00-07:00'
});```
and then when the code queries the Seam servers, the servers return (`code: '928052'`):
```{
  access_code_id: '6842a273-b833-4855-9794-ca00209e999b',
  device_id: '45723e4f-8494-4a42-a56a-8ac8e95052a0',
  name: 'Lyle Swanson',
  appearance: { name: 'Lyle Swanson' },
  code: '928052',
  common_code_key: null,
  type: 'time_bound',
  status: 'set',
  starts_at: '2025-03-13T18:00:00.000Z',
  ends_at: '2025-03-19T15:30:00.000Z',
  is_backup_access_code_available: false,
  created_at: '2025-02-22T00:10:27.597Z',
  errors: [],
  warnings: [],
  is_managed: true,
  is_external_modification_allowed: false,
  is_offline_access_code: false,
  is_one_time_use: false
}```
Every time we update the code, it changes it to something different.  If I run the same update code and then pull the data again from Seam it will show a different `code` value.  It seems to be setting the code to a random value.

[3/20/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> any updates?  Was the dev team able to reproduce the issue?

[3/20/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U06AY2HQXFC|Frank> could you help here?

[3/20/2025] SUPPORT (Frank):
Hey <@U01A6BVD03E|Tom Krones>, apologies for the late replies here — there's definitely a bug here with our implementation of update for Lockly codes, and we've reproduced it internally. It should only affect Lockly devices at the moment. I'll see if we can push an update out asap, but realistically it will be early next week when this is resolved.

[3/20/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
No problem.  Thanks for the update.  Please let me know when it's fixed

[4/1/2025] SUPPORT (Andrii Tymofieiev):
Hi <@U01A6BVD03E|Tom Krones>,
We've pushed an update that addresses the bug affecting Lockly code updates.
Could you please check the updated functionality on your end? Specifically, verify that when you update an access code, the correct code along with the proper start and end dates is now reflected both in Seam and on the Lockly device.
Thanks for your patience, and let us know if everything’s working as expected or if you encounter any further issues.

[4/4/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
Hi <@U02TQKHU2G5|Andrii Balitskyi>.  Thanks for following up on this.  I just checked, and it seems to be working from my end.  I asked the customer to also confirm it's working for them.  I'll let you know if they report any issues.

[5/15/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
<@U02TQKHU2G5|Andrii Balitskyi> <@U06AY2HQXFC|Frank> We are still having issues with this Lockly account.  Now I'm seeing an error when setting code and the user is reporting that access codes are not setting at all: <https://console.seam.co/workspaces/70966c94-c23d-488e-a5e8-eae95d4d6ce5/devices/31c69af9-3dee-4f55-aa48-cdcfc74d0cae>

[5/15/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
Is there a way that we can start an email thread about this and include the user?  I think we can get the solution must faster if you talk directly to them

[5/15/2025] SUPPORT (Andrii Tymofieiev):
<@U01A6BVD03E|Tom Krones> In simple terms: we sent the request, but Lockly’s API didn’t complete the change, so there was nothing for us to save, which is why you saw the error and no code appeared on the lock. We’re now working on adding clearer error messages and safeguards so this can’t happen in the future.
Sorry for the trouble—let me know if you’d like to set up a direct thread with the Lockly team to speed things along.

[5/15/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
But the customer is saying that the access code was never sent to Lockly

[5/15/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
Do you think it would be possible to start an email thread about this and include the customer in it? If you have any further questions, you'll get much quicker responses directly from them and removing me as the middleman

[5/15/2025] SUPPORT (Andrii Tymofieiev):
Sure, my email is <mailto:andrii.tymofieiev@getseam.com|andrii.tymofieiev@getseam.com>

[5/15/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
<@U05THNTEPD2|Andrii Tymofieiev>, I just sent you an email.  Thanks for the help trying to figure out why Lockly isn't receiving the access codes at all right now. Please keep us updated via email.  Thank you!

[5/15/2025] SUPPORT (Andrii Tymofieiev):
<@U01A6BVD03E|Tom Krones>
I wanted to let you know that we’ve confirmed the guest code *6236779* is in fact programmed on your Lockly device, even though our system initially reported a “repeat” error. After seeing the code appear in the lock’s records, we’re confident it’s active and ready for use.
Thank you for your patience as we worked through this. Please let me know if you encounter any further issues or have questions—I’m here to help.

[5/19/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
<@U05THNTEPD2|Andrii Tymofieiev> Just wanted to check if you got the email from Curtis about this issue?  When you respond to the email, please make sure you reply all or I will not see the response. Thanks!

[5/19/2025] SUPPORT (Andrii Tymofieiev):
<@U01A6BVD03E|Tom Krones> Sure, can you confirm that you have received a response?

[5/20/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
<@U05THNTEPD2|Andrii Tymofieiev>, I have not received a response.  Is it possible that you did not "reply all" on your email?

[5/20/2025] SUPPORT (Andrii Tymofieiev):
<@U01A6BVD03E|Tom Krones> Yes, you right, I already got an answer from Curtis so in the next message I would also respond to your mail

[6/13/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
<@U05THNTEPD2|Andrii Tymofieiev> have you seen the emails from Curtis?  Can you please take a look?  It seems like one lock is working and the other other isn't.

[6/16/2025] SUPPORT (Andrii Tymofieiev):
Hey <@U01A6BVD03E|Tom>, sorry for the delay, have you received my email?

[6/16/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
<@U05THNTEPD2|Andrii Tymofieiev> no, I just checked, I haven’t received any emails recently 

[6/16/2025] SUPPORT (Andrii Tymofieiev):
<@U01A6BVD03E|Tom> You should have received this email

[6/16/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
Yes, I got that email. Curtis doesn't have access to the Seam console, please let me know if you need any ids and ill be happy to provide them. I would really like to get this issue solved so please don't hesitate to ask for any information you need from Curtis or me. 

[6/23/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
<@U05THNTEPD2|Andrii Tymofieiev> are you getting the emails from Curtis?

[6/23/2025] SUPPORT (Andrii Tymofieiev):
Hey <@U01A6BVD03E|Tom>, sorry for the delay — I’m on it. I’ve seen Curtis’s emails and pulled the logs for both locks. I’ve asked him to verify they’re online and their batteries/bridges are connected so we can re-queue the codes. I’ll update you as soon as he confirms.

[6/24/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
<@U05THNTEPD2|Andrii Tymofieiev> did you see Curtis' response?  It sounds like the locks are online.

[6/25/2025] SUPPORT (Andrii Tymofieiev):
<@U01A6BVD03E|Tom> Yes, I just wrote a response letter and set up a test codes

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
<@U05THNTEPD2|Andrii Tymofieiev> Do you think you can get on a call with Curtis to figure out this issue once and for all?  It's been months since we first reported this issue and have not been able to resolve it.  I think getting on a call and troubleshooting it in real time might help a lot to get to the bottom of this issue.

[6/27/2025] SUPPORT (Andrii Tymofieiev):
<@U01A6BVD03E|Tom> Yes, we can schedule such call on Monday

[7/3/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
<@U05THNTEPD2|Andrii Tymofieiev> Have you made any progress on fixing this bug?

[7/3/2025] SUPPORT (Andrii Tymofieiev):
<@U01A6BVD03E|Tom> Yes, we are in the process of fixing that issue

[7/4/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
<@U05THNTEPD2|Andrii Tymofieiev> that’s great. Do you have a timeline? Do you mind updating Curtis as well?

[7/4/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Hey <@U01A6BVD03E|Tom> - apologies for the time it has taken to resolve this. I was looking into this problem today and identified a bug with how we detect if an access code programmed on a Lockly device was modified externally.

I've released a fix for this but Lockly have very aggressive API limits and I'm unable to fully confirm today. I will do so the moment the limit rolls over

Given this is quite a long thread, I'd suggest splitting out a new topic/thread for each issue we come across so we get better visibility in our tools that manage ongoing issues.

[7/4/2025] SUPPORT (Unknown):
Chris Clark linked a high priority issue SHD-1492 Clear persistent “modified externally” access‐code warning

[7/4/2025] SUPPORT (Unknown):
Charles Pick - changed status to Done for SHD-1492 Clear persistent “modified externally” access‐code warning

[7/5/2025] SUPPORT (Unknown):
Following up - I tested the fix today and the access code (Chris Seam1) went through the life cycle correctly. There were no false errors about the access code being modified or removed externally.

[7/5/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
Thanks Chris. Let me reach out to the customer and ask them to test it

[7/5/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
This message was deleted.

[7/5/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
<@U0665SWKXPH|Chris> the user, Curtis, is saying the lock is still not receiving the codes.  Did you try adding codes to his lock?  He has given us permission to add test codes as needed.

Do you mind sharing your email, and I'll add you to our email thread. I don't think it makes sense for me to be in the middle, I'm just slowing down communication.

[7/5/2025] SUPPORT (Andrii Tymofieiev):
<@U01A6BVD03E|Tom> I can add a requested codes and report the results to Curtis

[7/5/2025] CUSTOMER (Tom):
I ran some tests with Curtis just now.  It seems to be working.  I've asked him to keep an eye on it over the next few weeks.  I'll let you know if he has any issues.  Thank you for fixing it!

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/6/2025] CUSTOMER (Bilal Khan):
Hello Team,

Looking for help figuring out what happened to this one device. Guest attempted to unlock the device and it seems we were given an unknown error. Don't have any better logs unfortunately.
Doesn't seem like it was a timeout, as it only took 2 seconds for the error to come through, but I may be reading the logs wrong
Details are as follows:
Device ID: `ca66c6eb-9d8c-4899-9f6f-7a8ff75f270e`
Action attempt ID:  `e6e7c850-9182-4803-80c8-38e5fa2bb7ff`  (One of three attempts, all of which failed in same timeframe)
Time: June 3rd, ~10:56 EDT

[6/6/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):

ASSIGNED TO: Jack Finley
TAGS: tri: needs bug fix
CREATED: 6/18/2025
CLOSED: 6/24/2025

SUMMARY: A customer reported an issue with Kwikset codes not updating activation times when check-in times were changed. The support rep clarified that the update was sent after the scheduled start time, causing the code to activate immediately, which is expected behavior. They also confirmed that event log timestamps are in UTC, while Seam Console timestamps depend on user location.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/18/2025] CUSTOMER (Emilio):
Hi team, not sure if this is related to a previously reported Kwikset issue but, a client is reporting that codes are not correctly updating the activation time when the check-in time is updated.
• The check-in was updated from 4pm to 8am on *2025-06-16 16:44:30 (UTC timezone) on our side.*
I checked the logs on Seam but don't see any specific errors, is there a way to confirm if there were any issues on the lock's side or the activation was delayed?
Also, could you confirm what is the timezone used in the event logs? is it EST by default?
Device ID: `9c003539-6182-4153-ab20-ee546d49dce1`
CodeID:  `f69f5bc4-db49-48a6-94f3-b42604261888`

[6/18/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U0492J30MJB|Emilio>, so looking at these logs, it appears that you sent off an update to Seam at 9:44am US-PST on 06/16 - to update the code to an early check-in of 8am US-PST for 6/16. Because the update was chronologically after the `starts_at` was going to be scheduled for, Seam just set the code immediately which is what you should see in the 2nd screenshot with the `access_code.set_on_device` firing off at 9:44am PST. So this should be expected behavior - am I interpreting this correctly?

To answer your 2nd question - timestamps from event logs will always be in UTC. The timestamps in Seam Console will depend on the user location (i.e. for myself, its US-PST, for your 2nd screenshot it looks like US-CST).

[7/7/2025] SUPPORT (Unknown):
Hello. I have a theory about what may be happening. We released a new feature last week to support August's excluded locks feature. I need to dig into this further. Were these locks previously "unmanaged"?

[7/7/2025] CUSTOMER (Jake):
Thanks for <@U0665SWKXPH|Chris> I believe it is previously unmanaged, but I already ask the user just to confirm.

Do you think this is also related to this other issue here? <https://hospitable.slack.com/archives/C041U284Z5K/p1751879207173609>

[7/7/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
I think so - I'm digging into this today. Apologies for the inconvenience if so as this is an untended side effect.

August introduced a new endpoint where we can mark a lock as excluded but I believe this is causing unexpected consequences where these locks aren't being listed at all (they should still be getting listed as before)

[7/7/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
I'm prioritising the investigation and fix for this today

[7/7/2025] CUSTOMER (Jake):
Alright, the user just confirmed that the lock is completely unmanaged before.

[7/7/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Thanks for confirming! Definitely not an intended side effect of this but I suspect it's related to us implementing support for their excluded locks

[7/7/2025] CUSTOMER (Jake):
Do we have an estimated time for when the fix will be rolled out?

[7/7/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
I hope to have a fix out for this today in the next few hours

[7/8/2025] CUSTOMER (Kelly):
Hi <@U0665SWKXPH|Chris>! Any update? :pray:

[7/8/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Hello! Apologies for the delay! I did further work on this yesterday:
• I removed as many locks as I can from the August "excludedlocks" feature they provide to parnters
• I reached out to their support team to remove the remaining locks stuck in this state

I can see this account now lists two devices again but if it should have more, let me know, and I'll try to apply another fix here as well while I wait for the August / Yale Access support team

Hello Team,
could you check please, what was the trigger to delete this access code `2b3a4a9a-6b2f-4f30-b04d-93596533223e` on the lock <https://console.seam.co/workspaces/d43c11d4-2641-4477-92e0-b49a1881ac3f/devices/9267e77a-c9ff-44f1-80f3-f97fa70c3f34>

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (orest):
hello,
the user came back with a question about whether the issue was resolved.

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U028H1K7F7C|orest> No meaningful update I can share yet unfortunately, we are still waiting to get more clarity from the Schlage team.

[7/3/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U028H1K7F7C|orest>, Schlage finally got back to us. The issue was on their side, per their team the lock got "de-synced" which caused the code to drop off based on their firmware logic in place. They are doing a firmware update and Seam will also be thinking about how we can add in logic to mitigate scenarios like this. Please let us know if you continue to see this pop-up!

TITLE: Guest accessed Yale lock before code activation time
CUSTOMER: operto-seam
WORKSPACE ID: 55a23fff-2bc3-4b3d-b247-6db15305bd5b
ASSIGNED TO: Jack Finley
TAGS: tri: needs bug fix
CREATED: 6/26/2025
CLOSED: 7/11/2025

SUMMARY: A customer reported that a Yale lock allowed access before the scheduled activation time. The support team investigated logs and confirmed the code should not have been active early, raised the issue with August support, conducted lab tests which failed to replicate the issue, and requested the customer to verify firmware and attempt to replicate the problem. August is still investigating.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Jassy Mann):
Hey Seam team,
A guest was able to open the door before the code was supposed to be activated on the Yale lock and our customer is asking how come they were able to get in before the check-in time.

We checked the Seam logs and can see door unlock activity using the code before the set on the device activity and are out of ideas on how this could happen.

Could someone from your team check this incidence?

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U02JEFQL5DJ|Jassy Mann>, sorry for the issues here. I'll forward to the team and keep you posted on what we find.

[7/1/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Wanted to add a small update -

I investigated all of our logs and from what we could see we did everything correctly and there is no reason this code should have been active early.

*Here's what we got back from the August API:*
```      {
        "_id": "6859afbcd0ffac63770580b6",
        "accessEndTime": "2025-06-27T16:30:00Z",
        "accessStartTime": "2025-06-26T19:30:00Z",
        "accessTimes": "DTSTART=2025-06-26T19:30:00.000Z;DTEND=2025-06-27T16:30:00.000Z",
        "accessType": "temporary",
        "callingUserID": "f14dc5e6-d9e8-4f12-8323-7ee61e142766",
        "createdAt": "2025-06-23T19:49:16.232Z",
        "firstName": "Michael",
        "lastName": "Thomasson",
        "loadedDate": "2025-06-23T19:49:22.586Z",
        "lockID": "6D5A5C81F646434D83A24BFD592246B8",
        "pin": "8831",
        "slot": 46,
        "state": "loaded",
        "type": "pin",
        "unverified": true,
        "updatedAt": "2025-06-23T19:49:22.587Z",
        "userID": "99662a16-ee51-41de-b91e-29c79a429bbe"
      },```
Note this is from _their_ API, and this is in UTC, so we are saying it should not have been active before 2025-06-26 at 19:30.

However, as you saw, this code worked earlier than it should have and we have *the webhook event that corresponds with this unlock:*
```{
  "context": {
    "body": {
      "Device": "keypad",
      "Event": "unlock",
      "EventID": "df548d91-3646-4daf-967f-8d052616099b",
      "EventType": "operation",
      "LockID": "6D5A5C81F646434D83A24BFD592246B8",
      "Timestamp": 1750957458000,
      "User": {
        "Email": "n/a",
        "FirstName": "Michael",
        "LastName": "Thomasson",
        "PhoneNo": "n/a",
        "UserID": "99662a16-ee51-41de-b91e-29c79a429bbe",
        "imageInfo": "n/a"
      },
      "timeStamp": 1750957459393
    },
  "timestamp": "2025-06-26T17:04:20.373Z"```
Which is several hours before we would have expected this to become active. *I have raised this with August support directly and waiting for a reply.* I appreciate this is a major concern.

*Further steps:*
I am also going to do some lab testing to see if we can replicate the same behaviour.

*How we program access codes:*
For locks that support native scheduling: we program the access code up to 72 hours in advance and then rely on the lock's native scheduling to control when this code is active (<https://docs.seam.co/latest/capability-guides/smart-locks/access-codes#native-scheduling|docs>)

*More about the device itself*
The timezone is set to America/Chicago but this shouldn't be an issue given everything here is UTC (indicated by the Z on the timestamps).

[7/2/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
August has not yet replied but I have chased them up on this today

[7/3/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Hello - August have said they are investigating. They also asked about whether the lock is using the latest firmware but the customer would have to verify this for us.

It may also be worth asking if the customer can help investigate by: setting an access code on the door (e.g. via seam), testing whether this code works a few hours before the starts_at time - essentially can we reliably replicate what this guest was able to do?

We lab tested an August lock and the access code did _not_ allow the door to be unlocked early. I have a few theories in my head but nothing concrete yet

[7/3/2025] CUSTOMER (Jassy Mann):
We have access to this Yale lock. This is the current firmware. I will ask customer if they are able to replicate this issue.

[7/4/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Thanks for checking this for us! I was hoping it would be reported via their API but it is not. I'll get back to August with this information

[7/14/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Thanks for your patience. I have followed up with August again today to chase them up for more information. This issue is still on my radar and has not been forgotten about

[7/7/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U054KS9L4AU|Kelly> <@U050AQKA7CK|Jake> - the locks should be showing now. We figured out what’s going on here but in order to push out a full fix we need the August team to update the information their API is sending us. We are in contact with their team and will follow-up as soon as we have more.

[7/8/2025] CUSTOMER (Jake):
Hello,

 I just checked this account under <mailto:618bishopops@gmail.com|618bishopops@gmail.com> and  I can see that 2 locks are now showing up, however on the screenshot sent by this user, they have like a total of 6 locks under their account.

The locks are still not showing up under this account.

[7/8/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Checking into this now

• f2d05e6e-7633-4179-a198-397d023668d7

We have asked August to clear the excludedlocks list for us but until then I am still able to manually remove them when I know which account id has missing devices (bit of a long story). I'm sorry for the problems you've had with these accounts

SUMMARY: The customer reported an issue with PIN codes not being sent to the correct device, and the support team identified that the logic for code generation needs adjustment. The team plans to patch functionality to resolve the issue and scheduled a meeting for next week to review the status.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/13/2025] SUPPORT (Forrest):
<@U02P77QG5H6|Jeff O’Malley> Addi mentioned another issue with the PIN codes sending to the switch instead of the pin pad. Should be sending to EK1xxxx instead of IGK3xxx. 

Can you add any more detail to the issue here so we can see if we can help? 

It sounds like Igloo needs to change their code logic so they don’t allow codes to be generated on the switch but happy to see if there’s another workaround also. 

Cc <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> <@U06AY2HQXFC|Frank> 

[6/13/2025] CUSTOMER (Jeff O’Malley):
We see 2 “devices” in seam.  Neither one will create access codes

[6/13/2025] SUPPORT (Frank):
<@U02P77QG5H6|Jeff O’Malley>, <@U067F5HD4BX|Forrest>, Seam handles that part of the logic, the only thing Wodify needs to worry about is creating the access code. If we detect a bridge/switch, we should be sending the job to the bridge/switch.

[6/19/2025] SUPPORT (Frank):
<@U02P77QG5H6|Jeff O’Malley>, I've just chatted with Addi from igloohome, and we'll look to see if we can patch in some functionality this week to get this working for y'all. There are some interesting nuances with the switch controller + PIN combination that we can iron out.

[6/20/2025] CUSTOMER (Jeff O’Malley):
<@U06AY2HQXFC|Frank> <@U067F5HD4BX|Forrest> - Can we get 30 minutes on the books for next week to review our current status? Thanks! <https://scheduler.zoom.us/wodify-jeff-o-malley/30min>

SUMMARY: The customer provided a new Android Grata app build for testing, which initially failed to unlock locks. After troubleshooting and implementing suggestions, including listening to specific events for credentials, a new build was tested. The app successfully unlocked doors under various scenarios, matching iOS app behavior, with a minor issue resolved by delaying actions on the deals page.

<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> <@U088TR3TV7B|Collin> I generated a new *Android* Grata app build with the details below. Kindly check if the unlocking works. Just login and it should automatically scan the locks after SDK initialization.

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> kindly check if the CST is valid for those locks.

Thanks

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U05KH0LDLJH|Max Stoumen> Can you help check that?

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Max Stoumen):
<@U04FDN7D34K|Harley Lovitos> <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> the CST is valid for those locks

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Max Stoumen):
It has "all access"

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> is there any error while testing or it just did not work?

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Max Stoumen):
<@U04FDN7D34K|Harley Lovitos> You are currently waiting on `listCredentials()` to be non-empty before allowing the user to unlock, correct?

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
Not sure what you mean. Currently what I’m doing is initialize the sdk and if the event phone_registration is emitted then I will do the unlocktotap.launch function to being the scanning of locks

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Diego):
<@U04FDN7D34K|Harley Lovitos> in Android the PhoneRegistrationFinished is sent as part of the setup process but it doesn't mean that there are credentials that can unlock a door. Could you please listen to the `SeamEvent.Phone.Native.Credentials.Refreshed` event? it has an attribute called `credentials` which is a list. If the list is not empty it means that you have credentials that can unlock a door

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
Ok will do that. Actually I have that on ios but will do it on Android too. Just weird that it was working like this when I had some testing on site. 

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (Diego):
One more thing: the type of the credentials that you get from that event is `SeamSchema.AcsCredential`. It has a `cardNumber` and a `credentialId` . You can play more defensive by checking if those values are not empty.

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):

[6/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> <@U07VCM0RBBM|Diego> any feedback on the latest build? Does it work?

[6/27/2025] SUPPORT (Diego):
Hi. Sorry for the delay to answer.
I did test it and I see that it calls the sdk correctly every time I try to unlock. I saw a popup telling that there was a problem getting the credentials, but it “worked” anyway. Unfortunately I don’t have a lock to try to unlock. I think <@U088TR3TV7B|Collin> can help with that

[6/27/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
I'll do android testing right now <@U04FDN7D34K|Harley Lovitos>

[6/27/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
<@U04FDN7D34K|Harley Lovitos> So the app can access the door as expected. Consecutive attempts work great. The use cases from the other thread were tested and both situations yielded the same results as the iOS app (i was unable to unlock via the deals page)

[6/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
Can you try to delay going back to lock screenafter opening the deals page

[6/27/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
Could you elaborate what you mean by that?

[6/27/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
I think Harley means "unlock from home page" -&gt; go to deals page -&gt; on that page wait 5-10 seconds -&gt; go back to home page and try to unlock.

[6/27/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
Gotcha, so yes in that case I was able to unlock the doors with a fresh install and with an install that was closed out. Both cases I was able to unlock the door after hanging out on the deals page for a little bit

TITLE: Error when updating access code due to uniqueness check
CUSTOMER: hostaway-seam
WORKSPACE ID: bc1cf708-f664-499f-9c09-4faa0dc6fef6
ASSIGNED TO: Chris
TAGS: tri: needs bug fix
CREATED: 7/4/2025
CLOSED: 7/7/2025

SUMMARY: The customer reported an error when updating an access code due to a uniqueness check across all devices. The support team identified the issue and deployed a fix to scope the uniqueness check per device, ensuring the error will not occur again.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[7/4/2025] CUSTOMER (Mikhail Klyuev):
Hi team, when we try to update access code `e8e2de57-22ec-42ed-952f-c1d67d78a86a`
We receive an error:
`The first 14 characters of Kwikset device access codes must be unique. An access code with the id e8e2de57-22ec-42ed-952f-c1d67d78a86a already exists with the name 43953294 Bronw`
Why are there checks like that on update request, the name is not changing, or could be changed a little

[7/4/2025] SUPPORT (Unknown):
Chris Clark created a new issue SHD-1509 Error on updating access code due to uniqueness check

[7/4/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Do you have the request ID for this by chance? To be sure I understand this correctly, were you calling the /update endpoint and this error was getting returned?

[7/4/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Okay, I think I narrowed down what happened with this error. Looking into this some more to see if I can raise a fix

[7/4/2025] SUPPORT (Chris):
Hello - me again. It looks like we were doing the uniqueness check across all devices belonging to the Kwikset connected account. I have deployed a fix for this so it correctly scopes the unique name check per device

[7/6/2025] CUSTOMER (Mikhail Klyuev):
<@U0665SWKXPH|Chris> Just to confirm — there won’t be a case where we send an access code update request without changing the name, and it returns a “name not unique” error because it’s detecting itself on the same device?

[7/7/2025] SUPPORT (Unknown):
Chris Clark - changed status to Done for SHD-1509 Error on updating access code due to uniqueness check

[7/7/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U041HDW3AG7|Mikhail Klyuev> That's correct - based on our fix that error should not pop up again!

CUSTOMER: flamingo-seam
WORKSPACE ID: Not specified
ASSIGNED TO: dawn
TAGS: res: waiting for response
CREATED: 6/26/2025
CLOSED: 6/27/2025

SUMMARY: The customer inquired if battery data is sent to Mission Control via the Seam SDK like it is with the Native Latch app. The support rep clarified that the Latch SDK syncs some lock data to the Latch server during an unlock and confirmed that no action is required from Seam or Flamingo.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Jude Chiy):
<@U08H32F14Q6|Matt>

When users use the Native Latch app, battery data is sent back to Mission Control. Is this also being done with Seam SDK? Latch had confirmed this was available already on their SDK

cc <@U01H7DV69PV|Parth Baraiya> <@U05KH0LDLJH|Max Stoumen>

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (dawn):
When an unlock is triggered, Latch SDK should call their passive sync function which syncs some information on the lock back to the latch server

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (dawn):
If AVB needs more data synced via that function, this will be something to coordinate with the Latch team

[6/26/2025] CUSTOMER (Jude Chiy):
<@U012TSERYA3|dawn> So nothing that Seam and/or Flamingo needs to do here, correct?

[6/26/2025] SUPPORT (dawn):
Yup!

CUSTOMER: BOOM
WORKSPACE ID: Not specified

TAGS: tri: needs bug fix
CREATED: 7/14/2025
CLOSED: 7/15/2025

SUMMARY: The customer reported an error when toggling the "Active" button on the Boom IOT page for access code generation. The support rep identified that the device was in a conflicting state and advised deactivating it in Seam Console and reactivating it in Boom, which resolved the issue. The customer confirmed the solution worked and inquired about applying it to all listings, to which the rep affirmed.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[7/14/2025] CUSTOMER (Jerric):
Hi Team! <@U06FMDPD01W|Serhii>

Our mutual client, Fragola Apartments would like to see and test how access codes are generated in the IOT page. However, when we try toggling the "Active" button, an error appears.

Can you please help us check how to resolve this? Thank you!

[7/14/2025] SUPPORT (Sy Bohy):
<@U08PPH45Q7K|Jerric> i couldn't find a match for this device uuid. could you copy/paste for it; also could you send a bigger screenshot, i'm trying to understand where you are in the Seam Console UI, thanks!

[7/14/2025] CUSTOMER (Jerric):
Hi <@U012TSFGM5M|Sy Bohy>, this is actually on the Boom IOT page.

We can use the property: Koletek 4/4 as use case, the ID is: 6d818b9b-6382-43da-88e6-a88331476ae1

Thank you!

[7/14/2025] CUSTOMER (Serhii):
<@U08PPH45Q7K|Jerric>, do you have access to the device on seam console?

[7/14/2025] CUSTOMER (Jerric):
Hi <@U06FMDPD01W|Serhii> yes im here:

[7/14/2025] CUSTOMER (Serhii):
I see It first configuration, so it tries to activate the device and move to the managed state. But it's already managed. So you can move to an unmanaged state on the seam console and then activate. In this case, it should work. The issue is that by default, it's inactive, but on the same side, it's an active managed device

[7/14/2025] CUSTOMER (Jerric):
Hi <@U06FMDPD01W|Serhii>, do you mean to "deactivate" it in Seam, then activate again?

[7/14/2025] CUSTOMER (Serhii):
<@U08PPH45Q7K|Jerric> Yes. Deactivate on seam but activate on Boom

[7/14/2025] CUSTOMER (Jerric):
Ohh i see it worked! <@U06FMDPD01W|Serhii> should I do this process for all the listings?

[7/14/2025] CUSTOMER (Serhii):
Currently, to make it work, yes. We need to implement better UX there.

[7/14/2025] CUSTOMER (Jerric):
Got that. Thanks, <@U06FMDPD01W|Serhii>!

TITLE: Request for PIN to access Space computer via TeamViewer
CUSTOMER: Grata Technologies Inc.
WORKSPACE ID: Not specified
ASSIGNED TO: Collin
TAGS: res: waiting for response
CREATED: 6/11/2025
CLOSED: 6/26/2025

SUMMARY: The support rep provided remote access credentials and troubleshooting guidance for the Salto Space system. They assisted the customer with accessing the system, resolved connectivity issues caused by a Windows restart, and reconnected the account to the Lab Salto Space. The customer was also provided with a new access link when the previous one expired.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/5/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
Hello Grata peoples! I did get approval from my CPO to give y'all remote access to the computer that we have running Salto Space at our office. This link (<https://share.1password.com/s#KFg_18ZOXzXFM0xLBgekOIFzlQ844rwfaiWNplgLLK0>) has the TeamViewer login credentials and the device you want to access is called "Space". Also, I put together a quick video (<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g4PexRuUVU2C49c5bhMoUnVkxpANr85h/view?usp=sharing>) that runs through the document I made yesterday and shows how one would interact with the PPD when updating locks.

Three things I want to note are:
1. If the PPD doesn't want to communicate with the lock no matter how many times you twist and turn the PPD on the outside lock face, you need to walk 10-15 meters away from the lock and then come back to it and try again
2. If "Bluetooth Low Energy" is already checked there should not be a need to update your locks as they are already set up with your needs
3. When y'all do go onsite, I think it is a good idea to set up a TeamViewer or some sort of tunnel to remotely access the computer that is running Salto Space (if possible)

cc: <@U04FDN7D34K|Harley Lovitos> <@U049DEY0P5F|Diego Castro>

[6/6/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):

[6/11/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
2948

[6/11/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
What is the Salto Space admin password?

[6/11/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
If you can click that blue circle icon, hopefully it will bring up a OTP like page and then input the local password 2948 again to get the autofill to show up

[6/11/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
If that doesn’t work I’ll be at the office in 15

[6/11/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):

<@U088TR3TV7B|Collin> is this Salto Space connected to Seam Console workspace id `35abcd9c-8729-4c0e-bc89-0373e36cb166` ?

[6/11/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
or this one `2f649ba1-5496-483c-9c01-7794b807a634` ?

[6/11/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
Ok I believe this `2f649ba1-5496-483c-9c01-7794b807a634` . I can see similar Doors in Salto Space and Seam Console. But why it is disconnected in Seam Console?

[6/11/2025] CUSTOMER (Harley Lovitos):
Is it because we need to run Seam Bridge? Sorry lots of questions, I just wanted to know more info about the setup just in case we encounter the issue on our on setup.

[6/11/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):
its because windows forced a restart on our Space computer

[6/11/2025] SUPPORT (Collin):

CUSTOMER: Kasa
WORKSPACE ID: Not specified
ASSIGNED TO: Jack Finley
TAGS: tri: needs bug fix
CREATED: 6/27/2025
CLOSED: 6/30/2025

SUMMARY: The customer reported issues with Schlage device data not syncing with Seam, including a device showing as 'Removed' and a name change not reflecting. The support rep advised using the `/devices/update` API with a `null` value to clear the `name` field, which should resolve both issues. The customer acknowledged the assistance.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/27/2025] CUSTOMER (Joe Luchini):
Hey team, Has anyone noticed any Schlage outages in the last 24–48 hours? Our connected account (<mailto:sst_schlage@kasa.com|sst_schlage@kasa.com>) hasn’t been able to pull updated device data. Device *SST410* shows “Removed” in Seam, but appears online in the Schlage app. Similarly, when I renamed *SST204 → SST204a*, the update didn’t reflect in Seam, and when the team tried to reset SST410, they hit some type of cloud error. Is there any additional troubleshooting we can try to restore our schlage &lt;&gt; seam sync? Thanks!

[6/29/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@UNTLUS1BL|Joe Luchini>, I'll forward this to the team and follow-up shortly!

[6/30/2025] CUSTOMER (Jennifer [ET]):
good morning team -  was there any update here or anything else we could attempt on our end? :slightly_smiling_face:

[6/30/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@UNTLUS1BL|Joe Luchini> <@U03PMPWA22U|Jennifer [ET]>, regarding the name not changing, it appears that you passed in a `name` field  = "SST204" which Seam is using as the source of truth for naming. You can use `/devices/update` and pass in `null` to clear that field and the name should then be updated to SST204a. docs here - <https://docs.seam.co/latest/api/devices/update>

Regarding the device showing as `removed`, we found that it's actually still in Seam but simiilarly showing a `name` as "SST208", even though the device name from the Schlage app is "SST410". Same thing, if you  use`/devices/update` and pass in `null` it should clear it out and will report as SST410.

[6/30/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
For 2), here is the device properties we're seeing:

```"locked": true,
  "online": true,
  "_seam_name": "SST208",
  "manufacturer": "schlage",
  "battery_level": 0.94,
  "serial_number": "34000000000a496f",

[7/9/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U04QBUVJ9QU|Shiven>, if that hub states it functions as a SmartThings Z-wave Hub, it _should_ work with Seam, but we've never tested that model so we can't confirm. Additionally, Ultraloq isn't supported right now in Seam so I'm not even sure that the lock would load in correctly.

CUSTOMER: Vacasa
WORKSPACE ID: Not specified

CREATED: 6/24/2025
CLOSED: 7/14/2025

SUMMARY: The customer decided not to support offline locks due to code delivery limitations and will proceed with online locks, assuming successful code push. They completed internal API changes and are testing, but the creation of a web portal for account linking is on hold due to internal restructuring. The support reps suggested using the Customer Portal product to simplify the process, and the customer agreed to review it.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/24/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U01TH7118BH|Bret Hodge>, hope all is well! Wanted to ask if there are any big questions remaining besides the online/offline code thread we had. Also, does the team have any better sense of when you might want to launch a beta or PoC?

[6/24/2025] CUSTOMER (Bret Hodge):
We have decided to not support offline locks due to the limitations of not receiving a code immediately.  For online locks we will go with the assumption that the code returned will be successfully pushed when needed (we check the lock is online before creating a code and check the response is good as well).

I finished up my api changes today for our internal apis.  Need to test.

What is outstanding is creating a web portal for an owner to link their account with seam/vacasa.  I have a proof of concept done and working but have to move it into a repository and allocate resources.  however, this is on hold at the moment as we are working through some internal restructuring.  Will let you know more when I have a better timeline.

[6/24/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Sounds great, thank you for the update! Keep me posted on how the connection/mapping piece goes - we just rolled out a new product "<https://www.seam.co/changelog|Customer Portal>" that handles the connection + mapping + device management straight out of the box, so all you need to handle is access code automation (which sounds like you're already done with). If internal resourcing becomes a big constraint, could be interesting for you.

[6/25/2025] SUPPORT (Sy Bohy):
<@U01TH7118BH|Bret Hodge> +1 for getting you guys access to Customer Portal. It'll save you the build time of creating all this UI/UX.

[6/25/2025] CUSTOMER (Bret Hodge):
Thanks! I'll poke around.  The UI of the flow isn't hard and we will still have to have another step by which the owner would select the lock they want to attach to their unit our system.  I'll review it and get back.  Thanks!

TITLE: Issue with common code not setting on devices
CUSTOMER: Enso
WORKSPACE ID: d4198b14-8520-4b41-a370-514c31f09523
ASSIGNED TO: Jack Finley
TAGS: tri: needs bug fix
CREATED: 6/19/2025
CLOSED: 7/1/2025

SUMMARY: The customer reported that a common code does not work on specific devices of the same make and model, but the support rep requested an example code or access code to investigate further, as no 'failed_to_set' events were found for the mentioned devices.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/19/2025] CUSTOMER (GlennP):
Hello team,

Seeking your help with this one, please.

Seems that the common code does not set on both devices:

H1 Front Door
Device ID: 54f54614-8115-4ab2-9842-2272354f00bb
and
Laundry Door
Device ID: 17d826d4-e8ae-4e8c-9a39-518778c8fc19

Both devices are of the same make/model.

The same happens with H2 Front Door
Device ID: 6b1c8482-3fcb-4d64-9421-5c55944ea8d7
and
Laundry Door
Device ID: 17d826d4-e8ae-4e8c-9a39-518778c8fc19

[6/20/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U06K07YF7KM|GlennP>, looking into this. Could you provide an example code or `access_code_id` that failed to set? I am not seeing any `failed_to_set` events on either of those devices in the first group.

[6/20/2025] CUSTOMER (GlennP):
Hi <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley>, it’s more the common code does not work on these devices even when these have the same make and model.

[6/24/2025] CUSTOMER (GlennP):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> following up on this, please? Thanks,

[6/24/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U06K07YF7KM|GlennP>, happy to look into it, but I need an example of a `common_code_key` or access code that didn't work, otherwise I don't have much to give to the team to investigate. As I mentioned earlier, I am not seeing any `failed_to_set` events for those first 2 devices.

CREATED: 7/8/2025
CLOSED: 7/15/2025

SUMMARY: The customer encountered a 401 unauthorized error while using a GitHub PAT for the Seam Android SDK setup. The support rep clarified that the PAT format was incorrect, provided steps to generate a valid PAT with the correct scope, and confirmed the username should be the GitHub username.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[7/8/2025] CUSTOMER (Oleg Shpatacovski):
Hey!
I'm following this documentation: <https://github.com/seampkg/seam-mobile-sdk/tree/main/examples/seam-android-example-app> and got to this section: _*Credentials (local.properties).*_
I'm already using/having this pat: `seam_at12fXXXXXXXX` but unfortunately not sure about the username, the documentation says to use the GitHub username, which in my case is `olegrdvk` (corporate git account) however getting 401 unauthorized error.
Am I doing something wrong? :thinking_face:
Thank you in advance! :raised_hands:

[7/8/2025] SUPPORT (Diego):
Hi, Oleg. I'm the Android dev at Seam and I'll help you setting up the SDK.

[7/8/2025] SUPPORT (Diego):
your github PAT doesn't look correct to me. It should be something like `ghp_rnmXXXXX` ...
Where did you get that PAT from?

[7/8/2025] SUPPORT (Diego):
to create a PAT you can follow the steps below:
```- Go to your GitHub Developer Settings page: <https://github.com/settings/profile>
- Then go to `Developer Settings -&gt; Personal access tokens -&gt; Tokens (Classic)`
- Click on `Generate new token → Generate new token (classic)`
- Give the Token a note and an expiration date
- Select the scope `read:packages`
- Click on `Generate token` and save it```


[7/8/2025] SUPPORT (Diego):
The username is your username

[7/8/2025] CUSTOMER (Oleg Shpatacovski):
Hey Diego
Honestly, I don't remember for sure where I took the pat from... :thinking_face:
Thank you!

[7/8/2025] SUPPORT (Diego):
No problem. Let me know if that works :slightly_smiling_face:

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[7/7/2025] CUSTOMER (Navid):
<@U0516SR1FDY|Pat>, <@U012TSERYA3|Dawn Ho> will introduce you to the right people at Seam to work with as we kick off Seam development later this week. It looks like we have a new API, so referring to the existing implementation we have for our demos may not be good enough.

[7/7/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U0516SR1FDY|Pat> Happy to set-up time with the relevant folks on our end to kick-you off with development for this week. As Navid alluded to, we have our new Access Grants API which is meant to greatly simplify the credential provisioning process, so we can walk you through it then.

Let me know if you have any time-slots that will work well this week.

[7/8/2025] CUSTOMER (Pat):
Hey <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley>! Excited to hear the updates and kick off the next phase of our development!
I’m based in Colorado so my timezone is MDT for all of these timeslots. Here’s my availability for this week:
• Wednesday 8:30a-9a, 9:30a-12:30p, 2p-4:30p

ASSIGNED TO: Jack Finley
TAGS: tri: needs bug fix
CREATED: 6/24/2025
CLOSED: 6/25/2025

SUMMARY: The customer reported an issue with a lock showing 3000 codes in Setting and Removing states, with none processing correctly, and unmanaged codes appearing in the Yale app. The support team resolved the issue by clearing all the codes, and the customer was informed to check if anything else was missing.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/24/2025] CUSTOMER (Jassy Mann):
Hi Seam team,
Hope you are doing well!
We have a lock in Seam that is showing 3000 codes in Setting and Removing state but not of those transactions are going through. Moreover, there shouldn't be 3000 codes on this lock. All the codes that are showing installed in the Yale app are showing up as Unmanaged codes. Do we know how we can clear the codes stuck in Removing state and start installing codes in Setting state?

Let me know if you need anything else from our end.

<https://console.seam.co/workspaces/55a23fff-2bc3-4b3d-b247-6db15305bd5b/devices/6ab7947b-4e9d-4b1e-a8f5-46254c4a0c22>

[6/24/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U02JEFQL5DJ|Jassy Mann>, this is a strange case. Don't think we have seen this before - will forward to the team. Do you know how many codes you're expecting to show up? Is it just the unmanaged codes + the scheduled ones in `unset` status?

[6/24/2025] CUSTOMER (Jassy Mann):
We expect unmanaged codes + the attached codes to be on the lock.

Please note that customer added multiple Unmanaged codes since the system was unable to install them, so we have an inflated number of unmanages codes which might also be included in the attachments.

[6/25/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U02JEFQL5DJ|Jassy Mann>, this should be fixed, all of those codes have been cleared out. Let us know if anything else is missing!

CLOSED: 7/14/2025

SUMMARY: The customer inquired about the availability of camera integrations, specifically mentioning Ring as the most requested brand. The support team discussed potential solutions, including a UI component for camera feeds, and scheduled a meeting to better understand the customer's use case and required features for implementation.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/16/2025] CUSTOMER (Simon Seroussi):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> - Hey guys!
Hope all is well.

Curious as to when Cameras will be available?
We know it's a big lift as we've look as it directly too, but I see it as 'coming soon' on your website :wink: Is this a 2025 project?

[6/16/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
<@U05EAG559U2|Simon Seroussi> I know Sy really wants to add them to our offering - to your point its a huge lift and our roadmap is packed right now. _Maybe _could have something in Beta by Mid-Q4 but that could be ambitious.

Are you getting strong interest from customers? Any specific brands/systems you'd be looking for?

[6/16/2025] CUSTOMER (Simon Seroussi):
Ring is 100% the most requested one.

I would probably be able to add 2,000 devices within 2-mo of this launching.

[6/16/2025] CUSTOMER (Simon Seroussi):
<@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley> ^

[6/16/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Ok great info to have, thank you! Yeah, definitely know Ring is really popular - will share this with the team and keep you posted if/when we make any notable progress.

[6/16/2025] SUPPORT (Frank):
hey <@U05EAG559U2|Simon Seroussi>, we haven't yet cracked the Cameras API, but I'm curious — if we had a non-API integration route, one where you could embed a Seam-hosted component, would that be interesting to you?

[6/16/2025] CUSTOMER (Simon Seroussi):
hey <@U06AY2HQXFC|Frank> — could you expand on this? 
are you referring to an SDK or UI component that could show camera feed? 

[6/16/2025] SUPPORT (Frank):
A UI component first. We'd be able to work on the SDK and unified API over time, but curious if a UI component would be useful to speed up your integration.

[6/16/2025] CUSTOMER (Simon Seroussi):
Would it be like an iFrame? Very interested

[6/16/2025] SUPPORT (Frank):
Yeah, it would! Did you get a chance to see our latest changelog? We're building embeddable UI components now, and I'd love to check to see how you approach new integrations and device types on your side as well. Would love to show you what we got right now if you're open to a chat!

[6/16/2025] CUSTOMER (Simon Seroussi):
absolutely open to chat. I think it may be better to chat with <@U05F078U1NU|Jean>, however.

We probably won’t be able to use UI components in general because we built our own and they have a lot of specific features that also relate to SuiteOp features + integrations that seem may not cover.

But, for cameras, we could likely make that work! 

[6/16/2025] SUPPORT (Frank):
Ah that makes sense. Would still love to chat to understand your use cases a little better, and then refocus it on cameras. Since it's early stages, it'd be a perfect time to sanity check the foundation of these new customer portals / components.

[6/18/2025] SUPPORT (Sy Bohy):
<@U05EAG559U2|Simon Seroussi> I’m gonna grab time with you tomorrow chat cameras. I want to understand exact use case and features we need to build on top of the video stream 

[6/20/2025] CUSTOMER (Simon Seroussi):
<@U012TSFGM5M|Sy Bohy> need my cal? <https://meet.suiteop.com/meetings/sseroussi>
looking forward!

Charles Pick - changed status to Done for SHD-1515 Locks not loading correctly from new Yale account

[7/7/2025] CUSTOMER (Jassy Mann):
<@U066W71LB7F|Charles> The customer actually shared 11 locks with our Yale account with Admin permissions, however, only 2 locks are still imported in Seam. What can we do to bring the other locks in?

[7/7/2025] CUSTOMER (Jassy Mann):


[7/9/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U02JEFQL5DJ|Jassy Mann>, sorry for the delay, I checked that account and see it is showing 11 locks as expected now - <https://console.seam.co/workspaces/55a23fff-2bc3-4b3d-b247-6db15305bd5b/connected_accounts/a6d977cd-a2c5-4958-a1e4-a0edaeae9cfe>.

*Hi everyone,*
Hope you're all doing well!

We’re getting ready to kick off work on the Assa Abloy integration and have a few questions we'd love to run by you — things like licensing, technical capabilities, testing processes, and so on.

CUSTOMER: Enso
WORKSPACE ID: d4198b14-8520-4b41-a370-514c31f09523
ASSIGNED TO: Jack Finley
TAGS: tri: needs bug fix
CREATED: 6/19/2025
CLOSED: 6/26/2025

SUMMARY: The customer reported a timeout issue when generating a temporary booking code for a device, and the support rep confirmed it was due to a provider issue (Schlage) at the time of the request.

CONVERSATION THREAD:
[6/19/2025] CUSTOMER (Bilal Khan):
Hey Team, could anyone investigate if there were any potential issues with generate a temporary booking code for this device
`12932a6d-4674-46f8-891e-72eaed7ebdbe`
At around 17:28 EDT on June 6th?

It seems we experienced a timeout (over 10 seconds) when attempting to generate an access code.

[6/20/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U04H4ECKAAD|Bilal Khan>, will forward this to the team!

[6/24/2025] CUSTOMER (Clau):
Hi <@U076PSRFY4V|Jack Finley>, do you have any update?

[6/24/2025] SUPPORT (Jack Finley):
Hey <@U08EMFJ6KND|Clau>, appears that it was a provider issue (Schlage) at the time of the creation, as the timeout signals that Seam wasn't able to get a successful response in time.
