# PyInstaller
#  Usually these files are written by a parent folder of source files.
#  And every source file will have corresponding folder.
#  So we have some path problems.
#  PyInstaller auto-generates *.spec and a folder build/ dir.
#  We suggest to place them out of source directory.
#  For example, you can run pyinstaller like this:
#  pyinstaller --distpath ../dist --workpath ../build --specpath ../../extras/specs src/my_project/main.py

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   The same recommendations for Pipfile.lock apply to poetry.lock as well.
# poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
