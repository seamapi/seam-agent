Hi team,
Can you help me check if this unmanaged code on this users lock is something that we created but only marked by the system as unmanaged?
Lock name: Cabin Basement
Lock ID: 14923119-8686-4010-870f-0621cdef220a
Code name: Brian Kem5f2
Code: 7995
Access Code: aeae87ee-5f52-498f-8208-e2daf28bcfa0
Looking at the timing of when this unmanaged code was created, it lines up with when we first attempted to create the code but got rejected.
Perhaps it was actually created/added on the lock but then somehow got marked as unmanaged? (edited)
```
